The interactions allowed for varied 2D presentations and manipulations: text as a graph, text with appendices for citation and for glossaries, text filtered in various ways. In the past year, the exploration of computational text has taken on a literal new dimension: 3D presentation and manipulation. One can imagine text as books to be manipulated as 3D objects. One can also imagine text presented as connected components in a 3D space, allowing for richer organization of context for purposes of authoring, annotation or reading. The additional dimension opens up a richer environment in which to store, explore, consume and create text and other artifacts including 3D illustrations and simulated objects. One can literally imagine computable containers as a part of the “text” universe. Active objects that can auto-update and signal their status in a 3D environment. Some of these ideas are not new. The Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) funded a project called a Spatial Database Management System at the MIT Media Lab in which content was found in simulated filing cabinets arranged in a 3D space. One “flew” through the information space to explore its contents. What is new is the development of high resolution 3D headsets that have sufficiently high resolution and sensing capability so as to eliminate earlier proprioceptive confusion that led to dizziness and even nausea with extended use. <br>	The virtual environment these devices create permit convenient manipulation of artefacts as if they existed in real space. One of the most powerful organizing principles humans exhibit is spatial memory. We know where papers are that are piled up on our desks (“about three inches from the top…”). VR environments not only exercise this facility but also allow compelling renderings of information, for example, highlighting relevant text objects in response to a search. Imagine walking in the “stacks” in a virtual library and having books light up because they have relevant information responsive to your search. One could assemble a virtual library of books (and other text artefacts) from online resources for purposes of preparing to engage in a research project. Could we call this an information workbench or machine shop?&nbsp;Because of the endless possibilities for rendering in virtual three-space, there seem to be few limits to a textual “holodeck” in which multiple parties might collaborate. <br><hr style="width:10%;"><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>We are at a cusp enabled by new technology and techniques.

We have a brief opportunity left to dream of what this can be before big companies release their headsets and realise some of this potential. We now have an obligation to use the power of our imagination to think of alternative futures, un-clouded by the corporate implementations. Together, I think we can dream of amazing futures which can inspire future generations who will have lived with VR all their lives. We start with a slightly paraphrased quote from a relatively obscure Apple Macintosh commercial† from the 1990s: “The only limits will be the size of our imagination and the degree of our dedication.” Thank you for being a part of this journey. <b>We can only truly improve the future of text if we do it together. <br></b><br><i><center>Frode Alexander Hegland  |  frode@hegland.com  |  Wimbledon, UK 2022</center></i><center><br><hr style="width:10%;"><h2 id="D38B3CCD-CBB7-43D3-B078-B52343E726C5">Editor’s Introduction</h2><br></center><br><b>VR (including AR) is about to go mainstream</b> and this has the potential to offer tremendous improvements to how we think, work and communicate.<br><b>	There are serious issues around how open VR work environments will be</b> and how portable knowledge objects and environments will be. Think Mac vs. PC and the Web Browser Wars but for the entire work environment. <br><b>	The potential of text augmented with AI is also only now beginning to be understood </b>to improve the lives of individual users, though it has been used in various guises and under different names (ML, algorithms, etc.) to power fantastic services (speech understanding, speech synthesis, language translation and more), as well as social networks and ‘fake news’ for years. <br><b>	More important than the specific benefits working in VR will have, is perhaps the opportunity we now have to reset our thinking</b> and return to first principles to better understand how we can think and communicate with digital text. Douglas Engelbart, Ted Nelson and other pioneers led a ‘Cambrian Explosion’ of innovation for how we can interact with digital text in the 60s and 70s by giving us digital editing, hypertext-links and so on. But once we, the public, felt we knew what digital text was (text which can be edited, shared and linked), innovation slowed to a crawl. The hypertext community, as represented by ACM Hypertext, has demonstrated powerful ways we can interact with text, far beyond what is in general use. Still, the inertia of what exists and the lack of curiosity among users have made it prohibitively expensive to develop and put into use new systems.<br>	With the advent of VR, where text will be freed from the small rectangles of traditional environments, we can again wonder about the possibilities. <b>This will unleash public curiosity as to what text can be once again. </b><br><b>	To truly unleash text in VR we will need to re-examine what text is, what infrastructures support textual dialogue and what we want text to do for us.</b> The excitement of VR fuels our imagination again – just think of working in a library, where every wall can instantly display different aspects of what you are reading, having the outlines, glossary definitions and images from the book framed on the wall, all the while being interactive for you to change the variables in diagrams and see connections with cited sources. This could be inspiring or distracting but the key is you can change it at a whim. <br><b>	This is an incredibly exciting future</b> once headsets get better (lighter, more comfortable, as well as better visual quality). Because this cannot happen without fundamental infrastructure improvements, what we build for virtual environments–VR–will benefit text in all digital forms. This is important. <br><b>	The future of humanity will depend on how we can improve how we think and communicate and the written word, with all its unique characteristics of being swimmable, readable at your own pace and so on, will remain a key to this. </b>The future of text we choose will choose how our future will be written.<br><br><h3 id="8E810BE4-F679-4551-AA2E-A1C60F983F81">Why VR, Why Now?</h3><br><br>My starting position is that VR, sometimes also called ‘metaverse’ these days and ‘cyberspace’ before, is about to go mainstream. <br>	This is based on Meta Quest 2, which is available for the mass market and currently outselling the Microsoft Xbox game consoles. It is just the start of what VR headsets will be able to offer. The view inside such a headset is already rock-solid, whatever environment is present, it looks like it is there, right in front of you. With Apple’s headset coming next year and improvements coming along as we have seen with personal computers, smartphones and smartwatches, this will rapidly continue to improve to the point where the visual fidelity becomes high and the discomfort low.<br>	The future is coming fast. It is worth emphasising that in the same way the room-sized computer was not really a clear precursor to the smartphone, the current bulky, low-resolution and narrow field-of-view devices do not illustrate what in the near future will feel lightweight and the visual quality will approach photo realism–it will feel like the world is transformed–it will not feel like we are wearing a heavy headset.<br>	What this will unleash we do not know, but what I do know is that we, as a wider community of authors and readers of text, need to get involved in thinking about–dreaming and fantasising–about what it can be. For starters, we will not be using headsets all the time, any more than we now only ever use a smartphone or a desktop/laptop. We will enter VR when we need to focus on something, similar to how we enter a movie theatre, or turn on a large, flat screen TV when we want to be immersed or watch general video ‘content’ on all our devices.<br>	The distinction between VR and AR will likely become different modes on the same device but will have very different uses. Where AR refers to the world, VR will refer to any world. There is also an interesting middle ground, where the view of the world is superfluous, and it is just there for a sense of place, where the knowledge objects being interacted with are in a space, and the background could be anywhere. This is demonstrated in <a href="http://futuretextpublishing.com/download/fot3-index.html#BA668F07-6B4A-4534-AC60-7E67A1F1761A">Yiliu Shen-Burke’s</a> work where the user can interact with a constellation of knowledge, and the background is simply a background, even though it is a live video of the user's room. There is also what is referred to as ‘reverse AR’ where the whole room environment is synthetic but the main object in the room is real, as built by the team at Shopify to let shoppers try a chair and then look at the room as though they are at home†. There is a lot of creativity as to where boundaries will be and it will only become more and more interesting.<br>	We had a historic opportunity to re-think text in the 1960s, and now we have another. This is a once-in-a-lifetime, once-in-a-species point in time. We are only a few years away–if that–from VR headsets becoming commonplace. The dreams of Doug Engelbart and Ted Nelson, among other true pioneers, have not had a place to put their feet over the last few decades. There has not been a foundation of need for improved text interaction from people. Now there is. With VR, it’s easier to see that there are new ways of working. Quite simply, we have an opportunity to dream again. <b>‘VR’ won’t be ‘VR’ for long,</b> same as ‘hypertext’ became the web then became just ‘online’. ‘VR’ will become ordinary very soon. <br><br><h3 id="0C2CEA8E-C81B-4554-B484-D7BD0C17A1EF">Why AI, Why Now?</h3><br><br>The further assumption is that AI will continue to advance. We are looking at is the emergence and improvement in automatic pattern recognition, classification, summarization, extrapolation, and natural language query-based information extraction for everything from speech to text and text analysis. We are also keeping an eye on the development of Self-Aware Artificial General Intelligence with a mixed-initiative conversational UI, since it never hurts to dream far into the future.<br>	AI, if left unchecked, can present real dangers for society, as seen already in the basic AI algorithms which shape social media interactions and more.<br>	AI can expand our understanding of creative expression. In this volume we have the experience of Mez Breeze who explores the art of AI and associated text-driven potentials. <br>	One useful way to think of AI is as a digital map. I came to think of this when my 5 year old son started navigating for us when driving in Norway this summer. Since the map was not un-augmented paper but a digital map on an iPhone, he was helped by always knowing our location and there was always a blue line suggesting where we should go, so he could tell me ‘right’, ‘left’ and what exit to take off a roundabout, in his youthful happy voice. The map did not dictate where we went, we could always choose a more scenic route if we felt like it, and the blue line would update its suggestions. <br>	More than anything, AI has been largely ignored when it comes to text. The Apple Watch I use I can rely on to accurately understand my commands, which is quite mind-blowing. I have refined speech to text in my macOS word processor ‘Author’ to take advantage of Apple’s increasingly powerful API. Some software provides coloured grammar when required and some suggest changes to writing style. There are of course relatively brute force AI analysis of masses of academic documents and there are writing tools which will write based on supplied text, such as GPT-3, but I suspect this is really just the snowflake on the top of the iceberg of what is possible. <br>	What live analysis can a knowledge worker hope for when writing? How about hitting cmd-? and getting a list of suggested next paragraphs (not the less-then-helpful-help-menu). Maybe there are a few suggestions, one based on what the author has typed so far and the author’s own body of work, one based on what’s typed so far but including all known documents in the author’s field and a third maybe also including what’s found on the web? This is the digital map approach, giving the user guidance, but not dictating. This is work currently undertaken by <a href="http://futuretextpublishing.com/download/fot3-index.html#F74F0D65-7BB9-4176-96BF-E2DBA9DC23C0">Pol Baladas</a> on Fermat, for example. <br>	AI is both ‘just beyond the horizon’ and also becoming mundane so it is valuable to try to understand, then to revise our understanding, of how AI can augment our interactions with text. <br><br><h3 id="FA1D4AEC-AE31-40F4-AB31-2056601BFC4E">The Future of Us, The Future of Text</h3><br><br>2022 is the year of a continuing pandemic, along with economic collapse, inequality, a significant war in Europe which threatens the stability of countries near and distant, as well as the underlying climate change catastrophe we are now seeing starting to make an impact on our daily lives.<br>	There is no question that if we are to survive, let alone thrive as a species, we need to improve the way we communicate and relate to each other. This will mean looking at how we can improve education, politics, scientific discourse and even how we can bring our spiritual practices into play to improve, quite simply, how we get along as people, how we develop shared goals and how we deal with conflict. <br>	Much of dialogue, from politics, law and international treaties, to social media, lab reports, journal articles and personal chat, is in the form of text. I believe that we have to improve how we interact with textual knowledge, otherwise we will be manipulated by those who do, such as social media companies, and we will continue to be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information. We cannot rely on face-to-face speech and video alone. We have to improve what text is, how we can interact with text and how we can represent text.<br>	From its invention almost five and a half thousand years ago, the written word has proven remarkably powerful in augmenting how we think and communicate. The transition to digital text has transformed text, a medium which before becoming digital was primarily about fixity, about thoughts being securely placed on a substrate. When text became digital, this attribute largely vanished, with text now being interactive. A user could easily delete any text, cut &amp; copy and edit the text freely, giving text a much more fluid character. <br>	What was initially a revolution when the editability, and soon after the linkability, of text became part of our daily lives, the magic of what was previously referred to as ‘hypertext’ simply became ‘text’, and analog text, previously only referred to as ‘text’, became ‘print out’ or ‘hard copy.’ The magic of digital text became mundane.<br>	Other digital media continued to develop however. This was all the while digital images went from wireframes to photorealistic and games went from abstract ‘asteroids’ to deeply immersive and interactive experiences. We collectively thought we knew what text was, and little innovation took place. However, as digital text proliferated at an astounding pace, overwhelming those trying to stay on top of research, social media companies and those seeking to influence popular and political opinion went to work creating powerful tools for textual persuasion. We got social media echo chambers with algorithms designed to provoke, to increase ‘engagement’ (and thus ad views resulting in greater revenue) and modern ‘fake news’ at the start of the war in Ukraine in 2014, when Russian intelligence flooded digital mass media and social networks with fake and real news to the point where it became difficult to discern what was actually going on. Fake news continued to influence people’s opinions at the same time as research documentation stayed hardly digital, with little interactions afforded to the user. There are many issues to be discussed in this paragraph and I’d be very happy to go through them in person, but the point is simple: Text interactions became sophisticated where there was an incentive to invest in it in the form of money and political control. Where the greatest benefit to the end user could have been seen, there has been little innovation or investment.<br>	We had a historic opportunity to re-think text in digital form but we dropped the ball. We don’t have the ability to ‘fly through cyberspace’. We have the ability to cut and paste in Word, click on one-way, one-destination, un-typed links and edit a document together in Google Docs. We could do more, much more. We could imbue all documents with rich and robust metadata. This is a personal issue for me. We could provide authoring and reading software as powerful as Apple Final Cut. We could have reached for the stars, but the market and the few companies making text-focused software decided on ‘ease of use’, and we were left with big buttons to click on.<br><h3 id="CD957332-DBFF-49E3-95A6-92E8DA44A8F8"><br><hr style="width:10%;">Improving not only VR Text or AI Text, but ALL Text</h3><br><br>It is important to point out that the opportunity is not just about working in VR or using AI augmented text. <br>	The real opportunity is that we will have an opportunity to rethink everything with digital text because the public’s imagination will be energised–all text can benefit from a re-think and new dreaming.<br>	It is clear that while text in documents will continue to matter, it will not just be text ‘floating in space’. It is also clear that better metadata will make text more usefully interactive on traditional digital displays as well. <b>This is a historic opportunity primarily because we can restart and think from first principles:</b> how to connect people and how to help us think with symbols/text. Our planet and our species is facing serious threats so it is important that we learn from the past and that we are not shackled by the past. <br>	We need to look at how we can usefully extend our cognition to better think with other minds, as Annie Murphy Paul discusses in her book The Extended Mind <a href="http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Dk-_DwAAQBAJ">(Murphy Paul, 2021)</a> and in her talk in this book. Jaron Lanier–the man who embodies VR– and who presented the keynote at the Future of Text Symposium puts it ‘The solution is to double down on being human†’. <br>	The solution is at the same time to extend our mental faculties to really take advantage of the flexibility of representation and interaction these future environments will offer us. Just as we are today hamstrung by being tied to the models of paper documents, we must expand our minds in entirely new ways to get the most benefit out of what can now be created. This will mean building systems which connect with our physiology to learn to ‘read’ and ‘write’ in entirely new ways. Think how text seems entirely artificial if you take a human’s situation 100,000 years ago, but it seems natural today. Text is only lines on a substrate. What will be the future of text when the entire visual, aural–and soon haptic–field can be used for expression and impression?<br><br><h3 id="3061F689-C680-4E78-BF1C-562F64F28751">What does it mean to be ‘In VR’?</h3><br><br>Virtual environments will feel more like rooms or full environments than what we think of as textual ‘documents’ today. There will be intricate models of microscopic creatures for us to explore, we will be able to walk through cities ancient, modern and futuristic. We will also be able to step into spaceships and explore entire planets and more. This will be exciting, and valuable, and it will take teams of people a serious investment in time, energy and money to build these experiences. A great example is the work of Bob Horn who extends murals into multiple dimensions which at first glance is just an image shown large in VR but on further interaction becomes so much more than it could have been if it was simply printed onto a wall. We will also have new ways of telling stories, as Caitlin Fisher who works on the opportunities for more immersive storytelling in VR† discusses in this book. The opportunities are vast for what we can be in virtual environments but for this book and this project we are looking at text primarily, which will include many types of packages and experiences, one of which will remain a kind of book.<br><br><h3 id="35779A9B-6383-4F50-8C18-AAD72817B177">Documents in VR</h3><br><br>One of the key questions we ask is: What is a document in virtual reality, and more specifically, what is an academic document in VR and what does it become with AI augmentations?<br>	We look at academic documents as a special case since academia is a field connected by documents and it is also a field where what is in the documents needs to interacted with and connected. <br>	This is distinct from commercial books where the owners of the intellectual property have reason to restrain the use of the text and is therefore a different strand of the future of text, one with constraints outside of what we are currently looking for. We are, by the nature of trying to look into the future and wish what might be to augment how we think and communicate, dreamers, and as such our playground is information which is free to a large extent. <br>	There are limits to online-only documents which are worth noting, since it is easy to consider virtual environments to be online. The first is addressability and the second is reliability. Imagine if you could only get a book at the library by knowing its location, as in its entry in the Dewey Decimal Classification system–and not by the title of the book or the author’s name(s). This is effectively what web locations are; you can locate information based on location, not by content or metadata. Academic citations, which simply present the document’s metadata, such as title, author(s) names and date of publication, do not tell you where you can locate the document, but what information you need to locate it in many types of places, such as libraries and book shops. The second limitation is reliability based on the DNS (web domain system) where the documents cease to be available if there is non-payment of the DNS fees or if there is any technical issue with a specific server or set of servers. Many people exist in a tiny sliver of time, a few years before ‘now’ and with a few vague prods into the future to have an idea of their career advancement, prospective new home, the lives of their children and so on. Academics have to live in much longer timespans, almost no matter what field of study. Their research will include ‘up-to-the-minute’ knowledge but also access to what’s behind it. Similarly, academics have a duty to the future to make their work available long after they are gone. <br>	Documents for virtual environments can draw on previous types of documents and extend them. There is no reason why they should not have the option to be primarily text but still have a spoken presenter available if the reader would like to hear a perspective. There is also no reason why they should not be compressible into a portable document form like we have today. In this volume of The Future of Text, we can see how Bob Stein looks at the book’s essence in digitally empowered form and extends large collections of knowledge. <br><br><h3 id="4CB1D237-C567-43EB-81BB-0A6E6C886E19">Metadata Matters</h3><br><br>The more we look at how to realise the incredible potential of text in VR and text augmented by AI, the more it becomes clear that better metadata is needed to make it happen. <br>	It is better metadata which augments AI to be able to make better analysis.<br>	It is better metadata which makes text in virtual environments flexibly interactive.<br>Metadata is the data which makes data useful. A basic example is a document which can, but in practice in 2022 hardly ever does, contain embedded, or hidden, metadata to make the name of the author(s), the title and publication date known.<b> </b><br>	Visual-Meta,<b> </b>developed as part of the Future of Text Initiative (and which is also my PhD thesis result) includes this in the appendix in as simple a way as ‘author = {Name of Author}’ ‘title = {Name of Document}’ ‘month = {September}’ ‘year = {2022}’. This ‘self-citation’ metadata is what makes it possible to automatically cite the document, through a simple copy and paste, and to see it in a network of other documents, where the metadata is in the document itself and not a separated database. <br><b>	Visual-Meta is my approach to rich, flexible and robust metadata</b> and I highlight it to highlight the issue of metadata, it is quite clear that much work needs to be done beyond what Visual-Meta enables.<br>	All the multimedia objects are included in this so that they are flattened into 3D when published as a document and can be re-invigorated with all dimensions when viewed in VR. This includes spatial information of how the document should be be shown, by default, in VR 3D space. It also includes all the chart information and image map data. Including image map data in the metadata in this way means that a document can contain a huge mural, shrunk down to a double page spread in the document, but then it can be viewed wall size, with all data and links intact, at will. <br>	Since Visual-Meta was developed as my PhD thesis, I find I need to come to its defence and specify that adding the Visual-Meta appendix to documents is completely effortless for the author when the system supports it. What is put into the Visual-Meta is usually metadata which the authoring software is aware of, such as headings, glossaries and glossary terms, references, and chart and graph information, but this is currently discarded on export/publishing. Visual-Meta simply keeps it and makes it accessible. <br>	Reading documents with rich metadata included, and working with the documents to produce new knowledge, is more flexible and robust: you can choose what to view and you do not need to worry about transcription errors or data loss.<br><br><h3 id="EEAAAFE6-6E24-4214-9211-C38AAF40FC1E">Scale of Change</h3><br><br>Having considered some of the scenarios and aspects of working in a virtual environment I hope you might agree that the difference between a laptop screen and working in VR will be as large as looking at the world through a small picture frame and putting the frame down and looking at the world fully and richly. Personally, I think that, after a while, it will effectively be bigger than going from analog to digital, but only time will tell. It will be something new and it will be a fundamental part of our lives. “VR will never be the same as physical reality… We'll just live life across multiple realities. Each with their own physics, bodies &amp; affordances” says Andreea Ion Cojocaru†.<br><br><h3 id="663F6344-A2DF-4733-83FC-69035A9C4F9F">Concerns</h3><br><br>Some of the wonderful potential above seems almost pre-ordained. But it is not.<b> The only thing pre-ordained is that large companies will invest masses of resources to own this new environment to create highly profitable cashflows, as this should be.</b> Issues around the use of VR remain, such as how walking around virtually can produce a feeling of nausea for some, but if you instead pull objects, such as a massive wall-sized mural towards you with a gesture (such as pinch and pull) you will feel fine, even though visually it is the same impressions to your eyes. These usability issues are most certainly important and that is why they are being looked at by the companies building the VR environments. What they are not focusing on is ownership and transferability:<br><br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><h3 id="95FB4519-4B4F-453B-A63B-48967F662AD5">Ownership &amp; Transferability</h3><br><br>Considering that what is happening is the creation of a whole new world, it is probably not a great idea for a few huge companies to own all of it. <b>We need an ‘Internet’ for VR.</b> We need open standards so that our information stays free for use, to use as we see fit, and not trapped in a corporately owned framework, as happened with the Microsoft Office formats, for example. A simple dream would be to work on something on a traditional device, like a laptop, and to be able to don a headset, and take that information out of the screen and into the VR environment. But how can the VR environment know what is on your laptop’s screen and how could any changes be communicated back?<br>	<b>Questions we need to ask include: </b>What would happen if the document/knowledge object you worked with in one VR room, where you gave it fancy interactions and powerful views, simply won’t render correctly in another room when you try to share it with colleagues? It could also happen that we repeat the mistakes of digital text over the last decade and have shiny and involving social media text but little to interact with it to help us think, only share. We will need open, accessible and robust infrastructures to allow the VR world to flourish. <br><br><h3 id="762E2F10-5A65-4DA6-B564-478860345EAC">What We Are Doing</h3><br><br>To help realise the potential of richly interactive text in a virtual and traditional environment, text which is directly manipulable and which can be interacted with through AI systems, we are experimenting and experiencing what the future of text can be.<br>	We also experiment with VR environments, where what we learn from experience continues to surprise us. On the positive side, it is impressive how stable the environments are, much more than we expected–when putting on the headset (we primarily use the Meta Quest 2), whatever environment we go into, it feels like we are really there, it does not wobble or feel ‘off’ at all. <br><br><li><b>Hosting the annual Future of Text Symposium</b></li><br>     <a href="http://thefutureoftext.org/">thefutureoftext.org</a> <br><li><b>Future Text Lab </b>with twice-weekly Open Meetings &amp; monthly Guest Presentations </li><br>     <a href="http://futuretextlab.info/">futuretextlab.info</a> <br><li><b>Publishing The Future of Text </b>series of books, of which this is volume 3</li><br>     <a href="http://futuretextpublishing.com/">futuretextpublishing.com</a> <br><li><b>Developing on the metadata standard ‘Visual-Meta’</b> (“exploitable self-contained self-awareness” Vint Cerf)</li><br>     <a href="http://visual-meta.info/">visual-meta.info</a> <br><li><b>Building the ‘Author’ and ‘Reader’ software</b></li>†<br>     <a href="http://augmentedtext.info/">augmentedtext.info</a> <br><br><h3 id="BE068C4B-A12E-48AC-BDF2-CE62B9184B0F">The Bottom Line : Invitation &amp; Dream</h3><br><br>At the end of the day I am asking you, if you are ‘sold’ on the idea that VR or the ‘metaverse’ will become mainstream over the next few years, to consider what this truly could be to help us think and communicate, to help us work and learn–as well as how you can help inspire others to ask the same questions. Then I ask you to consider how we can keep this environment open and not as a series of corporate workrooms isolated from each other and the rest of our information. <br><b>	In publishing this I am inviting you to join us in dialog</b> about what text can and should be in an environment where text can be pretty much anything our imagination points to and implementation allows. <br>	<b>The imagining and dreaming needed to create a powerfully useful work environment in VR will be huge. </b>It is exceptionally difficult to see and dream beyond a linear extrapolation of what we experience. We, therefore, need to support those who have the capacity to dream, in the spirit of Doug Engelbart, and foster dialogue for a broader community to dream together, and not simply fantasise, at a cartoon level, on a magic text which has no bearing on implementation. By this I mean purely shifting the act of reading and writing to artificial systems to somehow do the work for us. We need to augment ourselves, both through removing unnecessary hurdles and reducing clerical work, such as the huge amount of effort placed on the cosmetic aspect of citations and formatting for journal articles.<br>	The infrastructure to support the dreamt-up futures will need to be radically better than what we have now IF we want to have an open future for how we can interact with our knowledge and each other through the medium of the written word. The substrate of text used to be a plain material, such as paper or parchment, but now it is not the screen but everything behind the screen; the storage of the type, the metadata which makes the type useful and the means through which this can be shared openly and stored robustly.<br><center><h2 id="815A27D2-D551-4009-8F45-F285FD8310AE">Future Text Lab VR Experiments</h2><br></center><br><center><img id="FE552B28-7F30-488F-9CE8-C6DB986B1D37" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/00769C41-4F73-4C76-A75F-049AAAE329EB.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br><b>‘Simple’ Mural </b>A simple and powerful introduction to VR, this shows a single mural by Bob Horn, which you can use your hands to interact with: pinch to ‘hold’ the mural and move it around as you see fit.

I have therefore looked at working in VR visualisations of the physical room we are in and that seems to make a positive impact on this issue, as the Lidar experiment above illustrates.<br>	I have also found that while working on traditional software with <b>virtual displays</b> in VR-which it has been said by some to be the greatest use of VR while others say it is the least imaginative-is useful. A surprise was that while I have a master’s degree in HCI with Ergonomics, and therefore have spent enough time measuring gaze height and so on, when I put the top of the display a little above the front of my gaze, the bottom of the display went quite far into the table! This is of course not something a physical display could do, so it was a novelty to find this out. <br>	Furthermore, while working with murals in VR, it turns out that whilst moving with a joystick to see the mural makes me a bit queasy after a while, <b>moving the mural using pinch-and-move gestures </b>to lift the mural and place it where I want it, which is visually the same as using a joystick, means I do not suffer from movement sickness.<br>	Having <b>lines in space to show relationships is quite annoying</b> outside of very specific use-cases, as it feels almost like physical strings have been placed in your space. Similarly, text floating in space without a background can easily become very hard to read. <b>Furniture is also an interesting issue</b> since most people don’t have ‘VR Only’ rooms. Therefore the desk, chairs and other furniture must be taken into account when designing virtual rooms where the user can stand up and move.<br><br><h3 id="11A328CB-BCF4-4AE2-B862-953A41AC96D2">Suggestion for quick mass adoption of VR for work</h3><br><br><b>Premise: </b>Make it really easy to extend the users’ work experience and make it cheap for developers to support them. This is not about long term success of the headsets but an easy and powerful on-ramp for professional consumers.<br><b>Proposal:</b> If the user’s computer is nearby then instantly start in passthrough mode using the computer’s screen as virtual screen.<br><br><li><b>The screen should be re-sizeable and re-positionable</b> easily by dragging sides, even letting the user pull a screen to make a landscape screen tall and square or into portrait mode height.

So I think there is scope for a more immersive approach.

Perhaps we will simply move away from the use of text altogether.<br>	After all, speech-to-text is now quite reliable, and in many cases is faster than typing. Still, there is something appealing about using our hands rather than our mouths to create text. It allows us to work with text while continuing our conversation with other humans, which is very useful for collaboration.<br>	Because of the recent emergence of XR at the consumer level, a lot of people are now thinking about the text input question. But what properties should a “virtual XR keyboard” have?<br>	One of the great things about using your hands to type on a QWERTY keyboard is that you don’t need to look at your hands. You can keep talking with other people, maintain eye contact, be able to absorb their body language, all while typing away.<br>	I suspect that we will continue to value those two constraints: <br> 1)  the ability to continue talking with people while creating text, and <br> 2)  not needing to look at your hands while you are creating text. <br>	Exactly what form that will take, as XR&nbsp;continues to go mainstream, only time will tell.<br><br><h2 id="6C43A649-74EE-4783-A4D9-4760548CB989">Bernard Vatant</h2><br><br>Got it, but never tried that kind of technology, and not eager to try. I've never supported headsets even to listen to music, too close to my ears. I rarely listen to music at all, actually, although it's a unique experience and I love it, but I need a lot of silence before, and after, and a lot of space around. And all those things are rare and difficult to find in this noisy world.<br>	The computer screen and the keyboard have been my ultimate concession to technology, because they still look like a page. But I try to go back whenever I can to paper, with my old fountain pen and bottle of ink. For me, text has the smell of violet ink, a childhood's smell. I have no smartphone, touchscreens (I had to search right now the English word for "écran tactile" which I had forgotten) drive me crazy, applications drive me angry.<br>	Augmented reality, or virtual reality, are arrogant and scary terms. There is so little we know about the real world, so much to discover in every corner of the real world, I could use the rest of my life to read every stone, every leaf of grass, every chunk of wood in my small garden, the way to move of every living thing I'm related to. <br>	I'm aware all this looks like the rant of an aging man, more and more a stranger in his epoch. This will not improve now, I'll turn 70 next year... some say this is still young age... but I already felt a stranger in my epoch when I was young...<br>	What else.

Traditional text has a ‘sense of place’ that doesn’t seem to perfectly match the one a user experiences in VR. People complain about how uncomfortable it currently is to read long texts in VR, and I think it has to do with that sense of place. <br>	How do you locate yourself in both a 2D text and a 3D world? Does it even make sense to force some artificial one-to-one mapping of those two mediums, or should we completely reinvent what text looks and feels like in VR?

A main benefit of text as a medium is that it can avoid or reduce the unnecessary distractions introduced by mis-applied visuals and in this way help with focus on the actual content. Unsurprisingly, the VR hype cycles don’t seem to contribute much in regards of improving how we go about our ever-increasing amounts of information.<br><br><h2 id="1B608766-4512-42EA-9613-5B1663F7E473">Phil Gooch</h2><br><br>Here is what I would like to see.

I love the tactile experience of writing on paper, and also typing on a keyboard.<br>	If there was a way to combine that tactile experience - which is something almost universal, that we can all share, irrespective of any auditory or visual impairments - with some kind of augmented reality, then this could be part of the future of text.<br>	But this would be beyond a 3D interactive visual hologram. We need to think beyond that towards something like the NeuraLink, where we have augmented thought and an augmented 'mind’s eye'.&nbsp;<br>	We interact with a physical medium by touch. And we close our eyes. And a beautiful, interactive world opens up.<br>	Of course, this is science fiction now.

The American poet Charles Olson situated this process of ex-ternalizing/tending writing from speech at the dawn of Western consciousness, speaking of how humans extend reality a/k/a (make meaning) together as mythology, which Olson understood as the way people talk about words, or “what is said [<i>i.e., muthos</i>] about what is said [<i>i.e.,logos</i>].”  In the poem “Letter 23” of his four-volume 20th  epic Maximus Poems  Olson indicts Plato for having “allowed this divisive / thought to stand, agreeing / that muthos / is false. Logos / isn’t—was facts,” and instead declares “I would be an historian as Herodotus was, looking / for oneself / for the evidence of what is said.” Thus, for Olson, mythology, rather than spec-fict stories of strange gods and goddesses, was a supremely local and humanly grounded occupation, an extended reality. <br><br><h2 id="25CCCA78-AB89-473D-878D-2D20E168F89D">Denise Schmandt-Besserat</h2><br><br>Communication devices are of long duration.

But it is worth considering XR (in particular VR) could accommodate new forms of discursive writing.  Earlier media (papyrus roll, codex, printed book, and the 2D web page) have each constituted a particular writing space. Perhaps VR could constitute a space in which text, images, and videos can be inscribed in or on a 3D space. This would be the digital equivalent of the millennia-old practice of inscribing on wood or stone. In VR, however, terrestrial physics need not apply: space itself becomes manipulable. In an "immersive book" the architecture of the 3D space—the layout of text and the relationship among textual elements— can contribute to the argument. This suggests a kind of digital writing that is both familiar and new. <br><br><h2 id="3F2C7ADC-5DD1-44FE-915D-FD82E7F8D248">Charlie Hargood</h2><br><br>XR offers unique opportunities in terms of both immersive experiences and new forms of interaction. However, we must be mindful that (like any medium) it comes with constraints and costs - and these costs are not merely fiscal, but spatial, comfort, and functional. We must be mindful as to whether the affordances it brings to an application outweigh these costs, and not fall into the trap of using XR as a gimmick for its own sake. While the immersive and interactive qualities have been shown to make meaningful contributions to cultural, entertainment, and education applications we are yet to see this for text or knowledge applications, or evidence of what the future value is in this space.<br><br><h2 id="2CE014F0-2826-4BE3-9A3E-675E08BF9128">Jonathan Finn</h2><br><br>People writing text on computer often print out a draft to get a better look at it. Why is the real version more present, and more pleasant? For VR to take over from reality for work, instead of just plonking a 'screen in a screen’ we may need to capture this mysterious ingredient. Resolution doesn’t seem to be the factor - maybe it’s being able to hold, move and flex the paper in your hand?<br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><h2 id="0ACAAC9A-0A12-4EF2-9F95-0C907E2EC74F">Johannah Rodgers</h2><br><br><b>Johannah's Graffiti</b><br>Never forget: On Zoom, everyone is a homonym.  We are all in the<br>process of being “written by” the networked electronic computational<br>devices we are using to communicate and interact with other humans and<br>devices.  Reading the Future of Text will help you to better<br>understand how this is happening and why it matters for humans, for<br>machines, and for their relations.  <br>-- Johannah Rodgers, Author, <br>Engineering Language: Teaching Machines to Read and Write in the U.S. 1869 - 1969<br><br><b>Johannah's Notes</b><br>As most people know, I consider all forms of digital communication<br>types of inscription practices. Zoom is an automated writing system.<br>The thing we all need to consider is what is being proprietized and<br>how this is changing human communication practices. Inscribed<br>alphabetic communication has always been a multimodal practice.<br>However, the modes of that practice are being reconfigured by the<br>machines that we are now using to “write” with.  XR is an inscribed<br>reality composed by humans and machines. It has all of the biases of<br>the past written into it but will also enable the expression of new<br>types of critiques. One question is whether those critiques will<br>result in any structural changes. The “platform” is the “writing<br>system” and that has been privatized. New systems of notation are<br>possible for humans across distances because of the participating of<br>digital electronic calculating machine networks. Human and non-human<br>communications practices are merging/_____ in new ways with XR. As<br>humans, we need to come to some kind of agreement about exactly what<br>those changes are in order to ensure that human communication and<br>human interests, as opposed to machine communication and machine<br>interests are prioritized over the next decades. You can say that the<br>20th C. was all about prioritizing machine interests over biological<br>interests and that the 21st c. may very well be all about the fate of<br>the biological interests that remain; will they be further<br>“de-naturalized” or will we begin living within the natural<br>constraints that remain? It should be interesting to see how these<br>issues play out.<br><br><h2 id="8E6B9334-FFCD-4BA4-B6B9-AE7BA84E13E1">Dene Grigar</h2><br><br>The impetus to move beyond our daily lives and dream other realities is part of the human condition. Being human means to long to escape the physical world where we are bound by bodies, earth, and gravity. Our yearning has led us to conceptualize afterlives that transcend the fundamental laws of science, to hurdle through space to explore the moon, to walk in the near perfect vacuum of space. But more importantly, we have achieved this goal to escape reality through imagination––dreaming and instantiating new ways of living and being through storytelling, film, and games. XR is yet another medium in which to explore the future of <i>new</i> realities, textual and beyond. <br><br><h2 id="EDFAF7DD-2AF2-442A-80D4-58DD6B44E477">John Cayley</h2><br><br>Knowledge work is a category broad enough to allow it to find a commodious dwelling place in XR, respondent to the developing medium. Text as tool of knowledge work has specific characteristics and affordances which will constrain its instantiation and effective presence in this medium. Textual practice is a variety of language practice. It is important for our culture because literacy has become important. We now have a very wide range of delivery media for textual practice but these are heavily biased, even since the advent of computationally enhanced delivery media, in favor of documentary, expository, and transactional language-driven functions, and also by the predominance of a still highly effective technology for the delivery of textual practice, the book, particularly the codex.<br>	The codex is a literal volume, but, suggestively, with respect to the 3D graphics which render textual artifacts in XR, the codex both underwrites and undermines what text may or may not accomplish in XR. Effectively, materially, text has (need have) no 3rd dimension in XR. Conceptually, it always already does not in the codex. Tablet readers prove that the pages of books need have no thickness and only require one (rather than two) planar surfaces in the world of 3D graphics. And this 2D surface, for text, only requires one contrasting difference to allow the text to be read: colour of the text vs. background. Consequently you can have text in XR but, at any one time, not much. You will still have the problem of gathering it into a (partially hidden, ‘closed’) ‘volume’ and of giving your readers in XR the time as well as the space+affordances to read what will be, simply, text, perceived against a 3D spatial textured background: an XR tablet in other words. Think of this in the context of our current day-to-day experience of text in space: This is almost exclusively signage, including gallery didactics, and advertising. Can XR do more than this? Better? If it did, graphically, wouldn't this simply be too much?<br>	XR will, as smart speakers have done, highlight the developing reconfiguration of recorded, composed, and generated language in aurality, by contrast with textuality as we know it. Current technologies collapse – problematically in my view – vocal recognition+production into literal text as parsed transcription. But emerging developments also give us tools and affordances with the potential to conduct, yes, linguistic knowledge work in aurality. In the midst of this reconfiguration is where we should look for new ways and means for language in XR and for further constitutive developments of our associated culture practices.<br><br><h2 id="FA82A08F-E61D-468E-965C-0BAC5CC4448B">Alan Laidlaw</h2><br><br><i>Note from one of our Lab meetings:</i> …where we put things, that kind of like how we offload our mind. I've been toying with a little bit and I'd love to talk more about this idea, –I've been calling it ‘new morphology’ of the the shape of a thought, pretending a thought has a shape. Not a scientific study by any stretch. <br>	It's more another thought experiment along the lines of if you could print an object and put your associations to it, or if it could be a way to track associations. <br>	Another example would be like, you know, you go into a board room, you're about to have a brainstorming session, but you bring a rock, Silly Putty, you know these other things, and you ask people to hold a sharp object while talking about X. Now take some grass and hold that. <br>	That's more of a thought prompter. <br>	But the other side would be,<b> are there physical affordances that would help us with the shape of a thought,</b> sort of how we would do composition if we were just writing articles. It has some interesting angles, but it's sort of like outside of VR because it's actually leaning in on the ‘holding things’.<br><br><i>Further chat followed up by:</i> Yeah. It's funny that as far as the physical object goes, that's difficult, but a lot of the inspiration for this exploration comes from Morpho Space by a scientist named Levin. <br>	There's also alpha fold and protein folding. And the interesting part about the protein folding is when the model is trying to figure out what the protein is going to be shaped like,<b> it starts with a zero point. It doesn't have a canvas</b> like we're used to thinking it's first off, it's a quaternions that it's using. But all of the atoms start at a sort of a singularity, right? A zero point. And then as the data, as it gets riddled with metadata. They start to push out and the kind of the shape of the protein starts to come together as it's getting further distanced. And I think that there's a lot that maybe foolishly, but interesting anyway to see that this is this is sort of how ideas come about. Like <b>we have these atoms that we don't even have names for that are parts of ideas before they even get to names.</b> And as the associations start to cluster in our heads, we associate oh to my version of of book has these frictions and these attractions, you know.

Investors are flooding in the seed round of this promising venture. The Guardian obtained a transcript of a private work session between Borges and Vygotsky. The discussion, centered on the process of concept formation and the mechanism through which words reflect reality, implies nothing short of a brand-new ontology.<br><br>For readers unfamiliar with the work of these two giants, we recommend at least a cursory reading of Borges’s Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius and Vygotsky’s Thought and Language before reading the transcript.<br><br><hr style="width:10%;">[This transcript is based on a video recording.

The entire conversation happens in what appears to be an empty scene with a white virtual box in the center.] â€¨<br><br><b>Borges:</b> Vyg, this thing – do you see it? What’s this?<br><br><b>Vygotsky:</b> It’s a box, B. I just put it there. The word “chair” is written on it because it’s supposed to represent the word and the concept. Let’s start with the simple stuff today, for a change.<br><br><b>Borges:</b> Vyg, okay, but why are we starting with the end? This VR stuff is supposed to be a brand-new start. That’s the whole point, isn’t it?<br><br><b>Vygotsky:</b> Of course. So we start with word and concept, then we work our way backwards, then, hopefully, forwards, and we see how things play out in here. We keep an eye out for different turns in the concept formation process.<br><br><b>Borges:</b> Vyg, please. Look at this box and at this word on it. We are at THE END of the concept formation process. The process that got us into this mess to begin with! The world is simply not a grouping of objects in space. It is a heterogeneous series of independent acts. The world is successive and temporal. Idealized objects like “chair” should not be relied on. There shouldn’t be any fixed concepts to begin with. Instead, everything should be invoked and dissolved momentarily, according to necessity.<br><br><b>Vygotsky:</b> B, sometimes I think that this predilection of yours towards subjective idealism is taking worrisome turns. Yes, Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius was brilliant, and you got them all wrapped around your finger. But this is serious work! We are not here to write another five-pager on magical realism. In virtual form, but this IS reality. More than that, this is the FUTURE of reality! Humans master themselves FROM THE OUTSIDE! The development of thinking is from the social to the individual. People first receive language which leads to communicable concepts and world views. Language and world formation rely on stable concepts, not fleeting impressions that “dissolve”!<br><br><b>Borges:</b> Vyg, what language do you see in here? This box with letters on it? What do these letters mean in here? Where is the chair? Can we sit on it? It is leather? Do we sit on it by moving out butts downwards or perhaps upwards?<br><br><b>Vygotsky:</b> What’s your point, B? Just get to the point!<br><br><b>Borges:</b> Vyg, there are no objects or concepts, at least no permanent ones. Not in physical reality, and definitely not in here. Is a dog seen from the side and then seen from the back the same dog? Only if you rely on thinking processes that manipulate objects called “dogs”! Only if you need to – pointlessly if you ask me – extend existence and identity beyond the current moment and into some weird – and dangerous! – permanence. It’s all made up, Vyg, it really is…! And, in here, the lie is outright unbearable!<br><br><b>Vygotsky:</b> What do you mean “in here”? What is so different “in here”?<br><br><b>Borges:</b> Everything! Let’s take this box. Look at it from the side and look at it from the back. Is it the same box?<br><br><b>Vygotsky:</b> Hmmm…<br><br><b>Borges:</b> No! Of course not! Every second, this box is exactly 90 boxes!<br><br><b>Vygotsky: </b>B, don’t go all techie on me. The only thing that matters is that we think this is the same box. Permanence and identity are necessary NOT fundamental.<br><br><b>Borges: </b>What are they necessary for, Vyg?<br><br><b>Vygotsky:</b> We need them to generalize, of course! We think by using concepts, encapsulated into words. Think of words as tools. That is how we can build thoughts on top of thoughts, using both our own words and those of other people. <br><br><b>Borges:</b> Vyg, you are describing the labyrinth of abstractions we need to break out of! We are here to design the process that breaks us OUT of it!<br><br><b>Vygotsky:</b> The labyrinth IS the process, B… Perhaps we can shift towards new ways of building the labyrinth, but we cannot exit it. There is nothing beyond it… Our functioning as human beings relies on this clear framework. You can call it a labyrinth if you wish.<br><br><b>Borges:</b> This framework of yours, Vyg, is clear. Terribly clear. That’s precisely the problem. You forget that we are both Theseus AND the minotaur. As thought become verbal and speech becomes intellectual, as you so often like to say, we both trap and chase ourselves inside it. [Sighs for a while.] Let’s run this scenario with this box of yours in here.<br><br><b>Vygotsky: </b>Which box?<br><br><b>Borges:</b> This one, over here, with “chair” on it.<br><br><b>Vygotsky:</b> From which side?<br><br><b>Borges:</b> From this side!<br><br><b>Vygotsky: </b>Now?<br><br><b>Borges:</b> No, when I said it a second ago!

This almost monosyllabic conversation about the virtual box continues for another hour. Then they break for lunch. When they return, the conversation continues to be monosyllabic although a clear change in tone indicates that they are now past the disagreement related to the box. Our best explanation for this change in communication is that, similar to a process often described by Tolstoy, the closeness between the two, in combination with the strange affordances of the virtual medium, has enabled them to abbreviate their communication to the point where it is incomprehensible to the rest of us.]<br><br><h3 id="4B448513-1374-4FDF-ADA6-5CF69B968982">Author’s Notes</h3><b><br><br>Lev Vygotsky </b>(1896 – 1934) was a Russian cognitive scientist, psychologist, constructivist and critical realist whose work focused on the internal mental structure of an individual. Methodologically, he focused on relationships, processes and levels of analysis. He is best known for sociocultural theory, a developmental school of thought focused on the relationship between thought and language as independent and dynamic processes in ontogenesis, phylogenesis, and within a cultural context. This dialogue speculates on Vygotsky’s position regarding language and virtual reality based on his book Thought and Language.<br><br><b>Jorge Luis Borges</b> (1899 – 1986) was an Argentinian writer, essayist and translator known for his trademark themes: dreams, labyrinths, libraries, language and mythology. His stories, non-linear narratives that mix fact, fantasy, hox and forgery, are generally considered to have reinvented modern literature. This dialogue speculates on Borges’s position regarding language and virtual reality based on his short stories Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius and Funes, the Memorious. Moreover, the entire conversation makes use of many of Borges’s literary techniques. Most of the time I stay close to what the main characters could have plausibly said in such a situation, but, like Borges in his own stories, I also diverge from that and use the two characters to purse my own arguments. Hinted at by the fact that the footage was recorded in Borges’s headset, this is the kind of thing he would write.<br><h2 id="CE3692F6-82CC-4E9D-8FBF-3FB05F4014E4"><br><hr style="width:10%;">Journal Guest Presentation ‘An Architect Reads Cognitive Neuroscience and Decides to Start an Immersive Tech Company’ : 13 May 2022</h2><br><br><b><a href="https://youtu.be/4YO-iCUHdog?t=678">https://youtu.be/4YO-iCUHdog?t=678</a> </b><br><br><b>Andreea Ion Cojocaru:</b>&nbsp;Hi everyone.

And this is pretty much what the story will be today.  I’m an architect. I have a master's degree in architecture. I’ve been in love with architecture and the idea of space-making for as long as I can remember. But there's a bit of a twist in my background in that, when I was young, I was learning letters by typing with my dad on a keyboard in the 80s, and I have this childhood relationship with computers and coding. And I’ve always been very passionate about philosophy. So a while back I discovered cognitive neuroscience and I began reading that from the perspective of an architect who can code and who is also an amateur philosopher. Reading this from this perspective and I don't know how many people read content neuroscience with this kind of background gave me all sorts of ideas. When I discovered AR and VR, and specifically VR, I just found this opportunity to start pursuing some of the ideas that have been floating around my mind, in reading cognitive neuroscience for a while, this started. So the company started about four years ago, and it's been a crazy ride. But I’m not going to start with what the company is doing. <br><center><h3 id="53D9A715-B5DC-4654-BA5A-E2D500B8C0D8">My plan for this talk</h3><br></center><br>I’m going to start at the deepest depth that I’ve ever started a presentation. So I believe that for us to be able to successfully discuss these concepts in the end, I need to be very clear about what my background assumptions are. Then, I also believe I need to be clear about how I think those assumptions work or can be implemented. <br><li>What kind of theories and knowledge do I use to imagine a mechanism? </li><br><li>Then, I’m going to go into how I’m using all of that to think of virtual space. </li><br><li>And then, how we are using those ideas about virtual space to try to create AR and VR applications that begin to test some of those assumptions.</li><br><br><center><h3 id="60817C49-B5EA-4FA5-8BA0-788999CF23DD">Assumptions</h3><br></center><b><br></b>So, the position part of the presentation.&nbsp;What are my assumptions?<br><br><center><h3 id="BA371DED-BC91-47F1-8F0F-3967A262ADCE">‘The Correspondence Theory of Truth’</h3><br></center><br>This says that there is a reality out there, and its structure is homomorphic to our perceptions. What does this mean? It means that we don't know really what's out there, but we know that there is some correspondence between some sea of particles and radiation and whatever comes to our senses. In the history of human thought, this is a relatively new idea. And in everyday thinking and knowledge and culture, we still don't really take this seriously, as in, we still assume that we're seeing a chair, and the chair is brown, and we look outside the window and we see flowers and there's a certain colour. And that that reality is out there outside of ourselves. And even in reading a lot of the papers that are coming out of the scientific establishment, a lot of it is really not quite taking this proposition to heart that actually there is a huge gap between whatever that reality is and ourselves.<br><br><center><h3 id="35491C27-35AD-445B-964F-97A19B418620">Refutations of&nbsp;correspondence theory of truth</h3><br></center><br>And here I want to add a note that, actually, if you read words that are&nbsp;coming out from the computational branches of evolutionary theory, you will see that the&nbsp;correspondence theory of truth has refutations and it has fascinating mathematical refutations.&nbsp;So they're actually people out there who believe that there is no homomorphism between&nbsp;whatever reality would capital R is out there in our perceptions, that we might be completely&nbsp;imagining everything. But I will not go quite to that depth today.&nbsp;<br><b><br></b><center><h3 id="DDE026B3-5E15-437D-A25C-87B4FC3175F6">Gap between perceptions &amp; out there: called enaction theory</h3></center><b><center><br></center></b><br>So there's something out there but&nbsp;there's a gap between that thing out there and&nbsp;ourselves, our perceptions.In practical terms, I like to make sense of this through what's calledenaction theory.&nbsp;This was introduced by Varela and a few others in the 60s and 70s. I think in the book called&nbsp;The Embodied Mind[43]was published in 1990. And basically, this starts to deal with the&nbsp;fact that, this mapping between who we are and how we perceive the world in the world is&nbsp;really not tight at all. And it's not just that it's not tight, but&nbsp;we're continuously negotiating&nbsp;what this relationship is. <br><br><center><h3 id="50ADF0BE-ACDE-4222-968D-9FE8D971A696">Cartesian anxiety</h3><br></center><br>And the reason why embodied cognition and the forum called&nbsp;inactive cognition is very important is because it triggered a dialogue across science and&nbsp;culture that was about escaping what's called the Cartesian anxiety. So for many centuries,&nbsp;especially European-centric thinking was based on this idea that there is the subject and&nbsp;object, and they are two different things. That we have subjectivism, how things feel, and&nbsp;then there's objectivism, there is the world out there. And there are still a lot of struggles&nbsp;going on in a lot of fields to escape this Cartesian anxiety. It even goes into interesting&nbsp;discussions these days of what is consciousness and qualia and all of that and if we have free&nbsp;will, this is also about free will and all of that. <br><b><br></b><center><h3 id="012B5615-EFE6-4AE2-8895-8FC2493729CB">Varela's&nbsp;inactive cognition</h3></center><b><center><br></center></b><br>My particular stance is to embrace Varela's&nbsp;inactive cognition and to stay there is no strict separation between who and what we are in&nbsp;the environment.&nbsp;We are defined by the environment and the environment defines us, and&nbsp;our entire organism is about negotiating this relationship. I know this is still a bit unclear, so I&nbsp;will just try to go a bit further into this. Basically, the proposition is that environments are&nbsp;shaped into significance, and these are quotes from the Embodied Mind by Varela. “Shaped&nbsp;into significance and intelligence shifts from being the capacity to solve a problem to the&nbsp;capacity to enter into a shared world of significance.” <br><br><center><h3 id="BBB95ADC-C950-4392-A051-973426DEA138">Structurally coupling</h3></center><b><center><br></center></b><center><br></center>Or, “Cognition consists in the&nbsp;enactment or bringing forth of a world by a viable history of structural coupling.”So we&nbsp;become structurally coupled with the environment, and both our minds, our organism, and&nbsp;environment are adjusted through this structural coupling. <br><br><center><h3 id="C5BB618A-6793-4013-82C4-4ECCB1FDC556">Bees &amp; flowers example</h3><br></center><br>And one interesting example that&nbsp;he gives in the book is of bees and flowers. We don't know if bees evolve the way they are&nbsp;because they are attracted to flowers who offer them nourishment, or the other way around,&nbsp;that flowers evolve beautiful colours because there were these creatures called bees that were&nbsp;attracted to them. Varela proposes that is neither or and that most likely both flowers and bees&nbsp;evolve together, to work together. So there was a common evolution because, from the point&nbsp;of view of the bee, the flower, and the environment, and from the point of view of the flower,&nbsp;the bee, and the environment. So each is both environment and subject from a different kind&nbsp;of perspective. And in that context, they evolved together through this structural coupling.&nbsp;<br><br><center><h3 id="AA761538-0C6F-4381-A730-3A9390CAED94">Frogs example from Macy papers</h3><br></center><br>This also ties back in terms of examples. To focus a little bit on examples now, if you're&nbsp;in Macy's papers from at the first conferences on cybernetics in the 50s, they were very&nbsp;concerned with research on frog sand I found that very interesting. So why were they so&nbsp;concerned with frogs? Because new research, at the time, showed that frogs cannot see large&nbsp;moving objects that... Actually, they can technically see but their brain just does not process&nbsp;large objects. So a frog is very good at catching small moving things like mosquitoes, but a&nbsp;frog will get run over by a truck. And it's not because the eyes of the frog cannot perceive the&nbsp;truck, is because the brain just doesn't process the truck. Large moving objects are not part of&nbsp;the frog's world. <br><br><center><h3 id="FD8AB7FD-07BF-46A5-9ABE-9745A0E4C1BE">Implication</h3><br></center><br>So that was actually very interesting and I think you can easily think of&nbsp;similarities or start to have questions going through your mind about what things out there,&nbsp;that are very much in the environment and they very much exist, we might even see but just not perceive because they're just not part of how we deal with the world and how we interact&nbsp;with the world, they're outside the structural coupling that we have formed with the&nbsp;environment. And, although, this has been proved when it comes to frogs and many other&nbsp;kinds of organisms,&nbsp;we still have a hard time to imagine that, when we look out the&nbsp;window, there might be things out there which our cognitive system is just ignoring,&nbsp;perhaps, seeing but just ignoring,and I’ll bring up some examples later in this regard.&nbsp;<br><br><center><h3 id="068007DD-227B-4145-A2D6-8CBFA30D7B65">How the&nbsp;human eye is perceiving research</h3><br></center><br>Another interesting thing is the ongoing research that's coming out about how the&nbsp;human eye is perceiving information. Here it turns out that, according to the latest studies, only about 20% of information that comes through the retina contributes to the image&nbsp;that we see to the image that a visual cortex forms.The other 80% is what's called top-down. So there's just other kinds of information happening in the organism that determines&nbsp;what we think we see out there, outside the window. Again, that number is now 80% and&nbsp;going up. And then, there's so much more out there in research in this sense. <br><br><center><h3 id="F2712BCD-33E2-4669-9E63-E51D31414A64">Hand  holding a cup of hot water research</h3><br></center><br>There's research&nbsp;that shows that if your hand is holding a cup of hot water, what you perceive from your other&nbsp;senses is different than when your hand is holding a cup of cold water. So just mind-blowing&nbsp;stuff that is just scratching the surface of this. Because&nbsp;we are still shaking off an&nbsp;intellectual culture of dualism,&nbsp;but also of this idea that we see what we see is what's really&nbsp;out there, many people still read about these things and catalogue them as illusions. <br><br><center><h3 id="1AF56E49-0007-417B-81A1-C9D63C2DE204">My research</h3></center><b><center><br></center></b><br>And&nbsp;my&nbsp;work and my interests are about trying to understand to what is their limit and to what&nbsp;extent are they really illusions. And the more I work on this, and the more I read about this,&nbsp;the more I’m going down the rabbit hole of believing that they're not just illusions, they're&nbsp;probably correct. They're probably what the situation actually is. But why? Why do we think&nbsp;these are illusions? Why don't we perceive these variations? Or why is it so hard for us to&nbsp;even take these things into account?<br><br><center><h3 id="B9FFFE8B-81D1-435F-9FFB-3DD589E289A8">Necker cube</h3></center><b><center><br></center></b><br> A lot has been written in what's called experimental&nbsp;phenomenology about the Necker cube. That cube that if you focus on it a little bit, it kind of&nbsp;shifts. And sometimes it seems like you're looking at it from the top-down, and sometimes&nbsp;from the bottom up. And again, everyone is cataloguing that as an illusion. It is not an&nbsp;illusion. And none of these things are illusions. <br><br><center><h3 id="C6ED6466-A10B-4D92-89CD-74C9B3C98A32">Merleau-Ponty:  fix perception to match a certain story</h3></center><b><center><br></center></b><br>But what's happening is, in the words of&nbsp;Merleau-Ponty, a French philosopher, very famous in the school of phenomenology says,“The world is pregnant with meaning.”So, we are born into a social world that fixes our&nbsp;perception to match a certain story. Our society tells us a story, and this story is very catchy.&nbsp;It's so catchy to the point where a lot of work and energy has to go into escaping that story.&nbsp;So our perceptions do not flip on us like the Necker cube. Because we are social animals and&nbsp;we share a story about what the world is. And what is that story? How powerful is that story?&nbsp;Well, it is that 80%. It is that, at least, 80% that is influencing the way we process the&nbsp;information that comes from the retina, for example.&nbsp;<br><br><center><h3 id="2C0C9542-B85F-484E-A1AA-8BF1255BB40F">Merleau-Ponty:  World is thick with meaning</h3></center><b><center><br></center></b><br>The other word that I like in this context, also from Merleau-Ponty, is thickness. He&nbsp;says, “The world is also thick with meaning.” So it is very hard for us to cut to this thickness.&nbsp;And because most of the time we cannot, or it takes too much energy, we just buy into this&nbsp;idea that there is a fixed way to interpret information and that is the shared reality that we all&nbsp;live in. And, of course, a huge component of this, that he also goes into in his work is a bunch&nbsp;of norms that dictate not just what you should expect to see when you look outside the&nbsp;window, but also what's the appropriate way of looking out the window, and the appropriate&nbsp;way of behaving, the appropriate way of even thinking about these things, as in, cataloguing&nbsp;them as illusions that come with a certain baggage and so on. <br><br><center><h3 id="554F0E20-E2C1-4CE0-9F90-3CAA3A6CB538">Lakoff and&nbsp;Johnson: metaphors are neural phenomena</h3></center><b><center><br></center></b><br>Okay. So what can we go&nbsp;deeper into the mechanism that starts to unpack how we interact with the perceptions and&nbsp;how they're fixed and what they're fixed by. And something that I found very striking when I&nbsp;was looking for the first studies and information on this topic, is the work of Lakoff and&nbsp;Johnson. They wrote a very famous book called&nbsp;Metaphors We Live By[26]. They are&nbsp;cognitive neuroscientists interested in or working in the field of linguistics. And you're&nbsp;probably familiar with the work. The&nbsp;Metaphors We Live By was about how&nbsp;language has&nbsp;words like up, down, backwards, downwards, that are used in an abstract sense.&nbsp;And&nbsp;their conclusion was that metaphors are neural phenomena. They recruit sensory-motor&nbsp;interfaces for use in abstract thought. And this was just mind-blowing to me as I read it. I had&nbsp;to read it several times, not because I didn't understand what it meant the first time, but it was&nbsp;just so unbelievable. They're actually proposing that we take things that we learn by walking&nbsp;around in the environment, and then we use those structures to think. So in terms of a&nbsp;mechanism, explaining thoughts and perception I thought this was just absolutely mind-blowing. And there's actually a whole body of research that, both Lakoff and Johnson have&nbsp;done, together and separately, and other people, that are putting meat onto this theory. But&nbsp;again, because it's so unbelievable I feel like we're still struggling to really incorporate this&nbsp;into our intellectual culture. <br><br><center><h3 id="9A0EBF57-C690-46CB-8028-6DBB7C305EDE">Varela: lay down a path in walking</h3></center><b><center><br></center></b><br>Varela also talks about how we lay down a path in walking. And&nbsp;a lot of people like this phrase, but many use it in a sense that's not literal. But read in the&nbsp;context of Lakoff and Johnson, I think, he might have actually meant it literally. As in, “Our&nbsp;thinking and our walking might not be different things.”<br><br><center><h3 id="73CF1690-0288-4938-BD71-00EE2FC9320C">Homuncular Flexibility</h3></center><b><center><br></center></b><br> Something that also points at a very interesting mechanism that deals with the&nbsp;muddiness of perception and thought is an article that came out in 2016, and it's about a very&nbsp;strange phrase called&nbsp;Homuncular Flexibility, the human ability to inhabit non-human&nbsp;avatars.&nbsp;And again, when this came out I had to read the title a few times because it was just&nbsp;so unbelievable. And it states basically that this thing, called Homuncular Flexibility posits,&nbsp;this theory posits that the homunculus is capable of adapting to novel bodies, in particular&nbsp;bodies that have extra appendages. <br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><center><h3 id="47377349-DAFF-4A26-9C51-4AE56DAB1CE7">Virtual reality allows experience of inhabiting non-human bodies</h3></center><b><center><br></center></b><br>And that the recent advent of virtual reality technology,&nbsp;which can track physical human motions and display them on avatars, allows for the wholly&nbsp;new human experience of inhabiting distinctly non-human bodies. Ever since I read this, I&nbsp;started my own series of experiments in VR and I have discovered, to my surprise, that is&nbsp;actually extremely easy to, let's say, adapt to non-human bodies, to feel like you're truly&nbsp;embodying all sorts of things. I thought it would take much longer than it actually did. So,&nbsp;with technology like VR, these kinds of things are not even some super theoretical thing that&nbsp;can be achieved in a high-tech lab in some universities somewhere. It's actually in the hands&nbsp;of teenagers right now who are spending more and more hours a day on VR platforms, like&nbsp;VR chat. But I’m digressing a bit from the mechanism. So this is pointing again to a&nbsp;mechanism that is quite fascinating. <br><br><h3 id="D07E735C-DFB1-48B2-9A73-20648D990E0F">Our&nbsp;identification with our body &amp; our limbs, might really not be fixed … spending a half a day as an octopus</h3><b><br></b><br>Even things that we thought were fixed, like our&nbsp;identification with our body and our limbs, might really not be that fixed at all. And again,&nbsp;reading this, Lakoff and Johnson, metaphors that we recruit through sensory-motor interfaces&nbsp;are used in abstract thought, all sorts of things crossed my mind like, “Okay, so I’m&nbsp;inhabiting the octopus for a few hours.&nbsp;What kind of sensory-motor interface has that&nbsp;introduced into my brain and how will my abstract thoughts be changed by the fact that&nbsp;I’ve just spent half a day as an octopus?”Now, Merleau-Ponty and the traditional&nbsp;phenomenology and inactive cognition that I’ve started with, have been talking about things&nbsp;like this since the beginning and they all contain very precise examples of these mechanisms.&nbsp;<br><b><br></b><center><h3 id="7C95B061-D0E1-4C2F-872B-2D3693F4C15C">Man with a cane example</h3></center><b><center><br></center></b><br>For example, Merleau-Ponty has a famous story about how a man with a cane is actually&nbsp;using the cane as an extension of his body, because people who use canes, blind people who&nbsp;use canes, report feeling the tip of the cane touching the sidewalk. So they're actually very&nbsp;precise in that description if you read what they say about how they feel the graininess of the&nbsp;asphalt and the pavement. They really feel that they are there at the tip of that cane. So these&nbsp;mechanisms have been known, but I feel like now they are starting to be taken, quote-unquote, a little bit more seriously or their implications are starting to unfold much, much&nbsp;faster before us, because of technology like virtual reality.&nbsp;And here is something that, for me, it's also a mechanism, but it does not deal directly&nbsp;with perception, the movement of the body, and thoughts.<br><br><center><h3 id="81A35DB0-BAC0-4A52-85AE-1FCC585982FC">Foucault's&nbsp;Technologies of The Self</h3></center><b><center><br></center></b><br> It deals more with the sense of&nbsp;self.&nbsp;And I know that the sense of self is a very different topic than movement and&nbsp;environment, but it's going to come up later so I want to throw this in here. Foucault, the last&nbsp;book that was published about Foucault's writings is a series of lectures he gave called,&nbsp;Technologies of The Self. He never finished those lectures. He passed away. But this is what&nbsp;he describes as where he saw his work going, and what he would like to do next. What does&nbsp;he mean by technologies of the self’? He's very interested in what he calls the ‘emergence of&nbsp;a subject’. He's very interested in how people feel like they have a ‘self’ and an ‘I’. How they&nbsp;describe that self and how that self changes. In this context, he's looking a lot at people like&nbsp;Rousseau and how Rousseau not only described the modern subject, but his writings actually&nbsp;contributed to what Foucault calls ‘The creation of the modern subject’. <br><br><center><h3 id="C2BA88BC-06E3-4003-960C-EEB59722B570">We; now have the technology for altering “self”</h3></center><b><center><br></center></b><br>And this is important&nbsp;in the context of us dealing with, or having on our hands a piece of technology that allows&nbsp;people to spend half a day as an octopus. Foucault says for a long time ordinary individuality,&nbsp;the everyday individuality of everybody remained below the threshold of description, and&nbsp;then, people like Rousseau come in and start to describe how it feels to be human, and how it&nbsp;feels to be a subject of the modern state of France and so on. So, from now on, I will refer to&nbsp;this as subjectivity in the sense of, how does it feel to be a human self, a human individual,&nbsp;what could contribute to creating that particular form of how it feels to be you, and what&nbsp;could change how it feels to be you, and under what context does that change? And it's very&nbsp;interesting to me that Foucault himself uses the word technology, although in his writing he's&nbsp;not specifically looking at tech the way we think of technology right now. <br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><center><h3 id="1DBF6FF7-5154-4587-9EB7-CF726AD53304">Summary</h3></center><b><center><br></center></b><br>So just a quick&nbsp;summary, we're like halfway through.&nbsp;But I want to summarise a bit of what I’ve been trying to, kind of, do so far:<br><br><li>I’ve been trying to establish the fact that there is a gap between objective reality and our&nbsp;human world.&nbsp;</li><br><li>And my work is about trying to understand this gap a little bit better.&nbsp;</li><br><li>And the mechanism that, basically, connects us to the world, that does this structural&nbsp;coupling, in the words of Varela, is malleable.&nbsp;</li><br><li>And we are just starting to scratch the surface of what that means.&nbsp;But the establishment of this gap is the one thing that I want you to take away from the first&nbsp;part. </li><br><br><center><h3 id="90893612-8B28-4731-AC56-653EE401B2BC">Next… recent research on perception</h3></center><b><center><br></center></b><br>I think I’m going to skip through this, but these are some of my favourite articles that&nbsp;I’ve been reading lately. They're all about how the things that we see might not, really, be&nbsp;about what's outside the window. They might be more about our own stories, and our own&nbsp;cognitive processes. It's that 80-plus percent that's about something else. And yet, we're&nbsp;talking about imagery, we're talking about what we think we see.&nbsp;<br><br><center><h3 id="F73FF20C-C187-4A81-80FB-06AE83FF3FDA">‘Binocular rivalry&nbsp;or ‘homuncular flexibility’</h3></center><b><center><br></center></b><br>This paper, in particular, maybe I’m just going to explain to you very quickly what this&nbsp;one is about, it's about this fascinating thing called ‘binocular rivalry’. These terms are, kind&nbsp;of, interesting sometimes:‘binocular rivalry&nbsp;or ‘homuncular flexibility’.I’m very happy&nbsp;when scientists get so creative with naming these things. So, what is binocular rivalry?&nbsp;Basically, they did this experiment where they got a person in a room, and they showed that&nbsp;person either a face or a house, and then, they put some kind of glasses with a screen on that&nbsp;person, some kind of VR glasses, that flashed for a fraction of a second either a house or a&nbsp;face. And what they found was that the brain decided to, quote-unquote, show the person, or&nbsp;the person then reported that they saw either a house or a face based on one they had seen&nbsp;previously, basically. So the pressing mechanism was like, Okay. I’m seeing a house, and I’m&nbsp;seeing a face. What should I give access to consciousness? Which one would be more&nbsp;relevant for the story of this individual? And the one that was, quote-unquote, shown to&nbsp;consciousness was, of course, the one that related to what the individual was shown at length&nbsp;before these flashes of images.&nbsp;<br><br><center><h3 id="404D7E22-B912-4F71-98F3-9903B19DD598">Implication of this research for feeling like an octopus in VR</h3></center><b><center><br></center></b><br>So in this gap that we have established between reality, human beings, and our&nbsp;perception and thoughts, where and what are the strings, and can tech pull them? I think we&nbsp;have already answered this with things like, the homuncular flexibility and showing that we&nbsp;can inhabit an octopus and almost anything non-humanoid in VR. But I haven't seen any&nbsp;papers yet, maybe because this is just too crazy of a proposition, that takes the next step&nbsp;towards Lakoff and saying, “Okay. How does inhabiting that octopus then change the way&nbsp;you think? Change your thought process?” And, of course, there is no clear answer to that.&nbsp;The waters are very murky. The situation is incredibly complex.&nbsp;<br><br><center><h3 id="EA92FE17-B81A-4B17-A8F3-8B5AAE9054B5">Cognitive processes altered</h3></center><b><center><br></center></b><br>But the fact remains that, tech is starting to interfere with these things.&nbsp;And it's starting to get more and more powerful.&nbsp;And we are starting to see cognitive processes being altered.&nbsp;I believe we just don't have a choice but to start daring, proposing things and forming&nbsp;hypothesis, and going into the murky waters of the complexity of this whole thing as long as&nbsp;we want to work in tech. <br><br><center><h3 id="43AB9D36-9545-4329-877A-54FF1C12E959">Relations to virtual space</h3></center><b><center><br></center></b><br>So how does this relate to virtual space? Because at the end of the&nbsp;day I’m an architect. And I’m reading these things, and what goes through my mind is the&nbsp;possibility to test these things by designing spaces.&nbsp;But before I go into a tentative framework that I’m using now, I want to start with what&nbsp;I call ‘Observations from Field Work’. So I spend a lot of time in VR. We develop a lot of&nbsp;VR applications in the office. I do a lot of events and talks in AltSpace and VR Chat. And I&nbsp;think it's important, before we dive into the theory, to also take into account just what are the&nbsp;stuff that I see out there that seems important. <br><br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><center><h3 id="62CA0AAE-6672-4BB3-B3BF-3D552FA5077D">The&nbsp;Control+Z effect</h3></center><b><center><br></center></b><br>What is the bottom-up side of the work? The one thing that I find fascinating is what I call the&nbsp;Control+Z effect. This is a series&nbsp;of behaviours that I started to notice in myself, and sometimes in other people as well, that&nbsp;has to do with things you learn in VR, or in another kind of environment that, then cross over&nbsp;to physical reality and they reflect an inability of the brain to understand or to make a call&nbsp;between, “Okay. What are the rules of this reality that I’m in now and what are my behaviour&nbsp;allowances here versus my behaviour allowances in that other kind of reality?” And I’m&nbsp;calling this Control+Z because I first noticed it many years ago, and it was before VR, but&nbsp;I’m seeing similar things coming out of VR. <br><br><center><h3 id="C4B2816A-01BE-46C6-BC80-AA815D236D9A">Experiencing Control+Z effect as an architect</h3></center><b><center><br></center></b><br>I want to say when I was an architect, I’m still&nbsp;an architect, but when I used to just do architecture every day without this whole tech stuff, I&nbsp;used to build a lot of cardboard models. But the workflow for my architecture projects was&nbsp;actually just many hours a day in a screen-based software product where I would just model&nbsp;things with the mouse and the keyboard, and then I would also, have in parallel, sometimes a&nbsp;cardboard model running of the same thing, so sometimes I would make decisions in the&nbsp;screen-based software, and sometimes in the cardboard model. And on several occasions, late&nbsp;at night, when I was tired, so my brain was kind of struggling a little bit. While working on&nbsp;the cardboard model and making a mistake, my left hand would immediately make this&nbsp;twitching movement, and my fingers on my left hand would position themselves in the&nbsp;Control+Z position of the keyboard while I was working on a cardboard model. And I would&nbsp;always be kind of surprised, and then, of course, similarly realize what had happened and&nbsp;catch myself in the act and shamefully, a little bit, put my left hand down, “Okay. There is no&nbsp;Control+Z.” But what was happening was, basically, my brain was, kind of, deep into this&nbsp;screen-based computer software where there is a ledger that records all the actions that you&nbsp;do in that environment in time. And you do Control+Z and then you go back one step in that&nbsp;ledger. So my brain had gotten used to the idea that, that environment, quote-unquote, and&nbsp;reality can also go backward. And then, of course, in physical reality the hour of time does&nbsp;not go backward. So that's the first observation.&nbsp;<br><br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><center><h3 id="916E40C2-F526-4E9F-8708-B5EE810281F2">Emerging social dynamics in VR Chat</h3></center><b><center><br></center></b><br>Then, I’m seeing a lot of&nbsp;emerging phenomena in virtual worlds.I’m seeing people&nbsp;discover new possibilities for being, for interacting, crazy things happening in VR Chat, if&nbsp;you're not familiar with that platform, I highly recommend it. I think it's by far the most&nbsp;advanced VR interaction you'll see, and worlds being developed, and forms of community&nbsp;building, and community life intermediated by this technology. All of that is happening in VR&nbsp;Chat. And they're years, years, years ahead from any other kind of experience, or game, or&nbsp;anything else that I’ve been seeing. So I’m seeing signs that there are emerging social&nbsp;dynamics and mechanisms for negotiating meaning in these collective groups and&nbsp;interactions that are extremely interesting.&nbsp;This is also a bit of a topic for another day, but I feel like it's so important that I cannot&nbsp;not mention it.&nbsp;<br><br><center><h3 id="867B56DD-52C8-419F-9CC8-F16AA075231A">We’re not the only intelligent agents today</h3></center><b><center><br></center></b><br>We're slowly but surely not the only intelligent agents anymore.&nbsp;We&nbsp;interact with bots on Twitter every day and we don't even know that they're bots sometimes.&nbsp;And people are experimenting with introducing all sorts of AI-driven agents into virtual&nbsp;worlds. We have Unreal and Unity putting out their extremely realistic-looking avatars that&nbsp;are AR driven and so on. So we're not really at the point where we go to VR Chat, my&nbsp;favourite platform, and we're not sure that the other person is human or not. But I think, well,&nbsp;I don't know, if we're not already there, we will be there pretty soon. So there's a significant&nbsp;layer of complexity that's being added right now on top of this already complex and messy&nbsp;situation, by the introduction of non-human cognitive systems.&nbsp;<br><br><center><h3 id="185687C4-AE8F-484A-9673-8A3FA6F8B769">What is virtual space</h3></center><b><center><br></center></b><br>All right, so what is the proposition for what is virtual space? This is how I think about&nbsp;it.&nbsp;A new environment is basically a system you're trying to solve. It's a little bit like a&nbsp;game. So this is the structural coupling of Varela. You go into a game, you go into a new&nbsp;building, you go to a new country to visit, you've just landed at the airport, the first thing you&nbsp;do is, you're trying to figure it out. You're trying to understand where you are and which way&nbsp;you go. Are there any things that are strange? Your brain is turning fast to establish, as soon&nbsp;as possible, this structural coupling with the environment, that gives you control over the&nbsp;environment and understanding.&nbsp;<br><center><h3 id="2D26717E-E895-418B-B5D1-9A4188A6F34C">You're actually also encountering the system that is you</h3></center><b><center><br></center></b><br>But I want to argue, in that process, you're not just dealing with this foreign&nbsp;environment, you're actually also encountering the system that is you. You're also dealing,&nbsp;and discovering your own cognitive processes that are engaging with the environment in&nbsp;attempting to couple. <br><b><br></b><center><h3 id="399F0016-DFD0-4288-A031-C0757D66AD65">Designing the environment and the person&nbsp;are the same thing</h3></center><b><center><br></center></b><br>So roughly put, designing the environment is designing the subject that&nbsp;interacts with it. So how would an approach to space making look like if we just assumed, in&nbsp;the light of all of this talk about cognitive neuroscience, that the environment and the person&nbsp;are the same thing? That, somehow, they're so tightly connected we cannot disconnect them.&nbsp;It's like the bee and the flower.&nbsp;<br><br><center><h3 id="468B1E12-FD3F-4674-9007-EC397F41AF7D">How would we design this environment-person same thing-ed-ness?</h3></center><b><center><br></center></b><br>If we were to pursue this kind of methodology, what would our tools be? Where&nbsp;would we even start?&nbsp;And I can only tell you how I’ve started doing it. I’m basically doing&nbsp;the best that I can to form hypotheses that have to do with knowledge that I’m taking from&nbsp;these papers, and knowledge that I’m taking from my own experiences and introspection.&nbsp;<br><b><br></b><center><h3 id="B86865DD-0C4A-404C-AB08-323A911D50E0">VR activates motor cortex</h3></center><b><center><br></center></b><br>One of the mechanisms that I’m very interested in now, and I will show you how we&nbsp;use that in one of our projects is the fact that, unlike other kinds of screen-based software or&nbsp;interfaces, screen-based interfaces that only address or mostly address our visual cortex, VR&nbsp;throws in the ability to control or encourage behaviour that activates the motor cortex. And&nbsp;this is an absolute game-changer because, as a lot of these papers reveal, it is the organism's&nbsp;attempt to integrate sometimes, perhaps, conflicting information that comes from the motor&nbsp;cortex and the visual cortex, that it's one of the most important paths that we have in trying to&nbsp;understand more complex cognitive paths.<br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><center><h3 id="07012DA3-5107-4417-B83D-DA2253BC44D5">Use VR to test modifying cognitive-motor enaction</h3></center><b><center><br></center></b><br>&nbsp;One way is to try to understand this relationship, and then to try to use VR to test&nbsp;things.

You can if you only show them and&nbsp;make them do what they would see or do in physical reality.

This is a, let's call it <b>art project, it's called </b>Say It. Basically, I designed these different shapes, they're in wax here because I was planning on pouring them in bronze. I never got to pour them in bronze and integrate these RFID tags into them. But basically, this is based on a story from Gulliver’s Travels. Gulliver goes to&nbsp;Lilliput.&nbsp;That's the country with the little people. And he runs into these&nbsp;Lilliputians&nbsp;that cannot speak in words, they speak with objects. They carry on their back a big bag with an object, that's a sample object of all the objects that they need to communicate. So if they want to tell you something about spoons, they will go into their bag and pull out a spoon and show it to you, and then you're supposed to like, quote-unquote, read that they mean to say spoon. So this intersection between language and objects, or objects as language, and then, the many complications that result when trying to use objects as language, because you don't have syntax, was something I became very interested in. So what is the syntax if you just have the objects? How does that arise? So, the idea with this project was to have two people and then give them a bag of these objects, and these are somewhere in between letters and objects. And to design ways in which this could maybe give some sort of feedback. But to observe how fast, or to what extent, or in what direction people start to use these to communicate. The people are not allowed to talk to each other, of course, so they're given something they're meant to communicate to each other and only have these objects. And then, they're given an hour to try to use these things to communicate, and basically, they have to negotiate meaning for these abstract shapes.&nbsp;<br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><br><center><img id="ECA9DF25-06BD-4829-8A2A-36A7792A5CEE" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/320F41BB-E281-427D-8451-6B902515C795.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br><b>This is an AR game that we have developed for a museum.</b> And here we used one of these approaches that I mentioned earlier. We hypothesise a certain reaction that would happen if we present the visual cortex with conflicting information from what the motor cortex is reporting to the central nervous system. And it worked. We were able to trick people into believing that their body is floating upward. About 20 meters. So we basically trigger the mild out-of-body experience. This is mild, it's something quite nice, it's a game that happens outdoors, it's triggered by GPS coordinates and you're basically exploring a story of the German [indistinct] in the south of Germany. It's very integrated with a story. It's a very mild thing. It's not scary at all. But we were surprised ourselves that we were able to use some of these theories to make something like this that actually, quote-unquote, works. <b>	</b><br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><br><center><img id="3A96F7ED-3CC1-4C85-ADBD-B9A69F238147" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/EC36B828-A86A-4CF0-9AE2-B01EF856CD1B.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br><b>This is a three-dimensional menu. </b>What you're looking at here is, basically, a folder with files. It's something that, from the technical knowledge that we have today, it's something very basic. Something a programming student will understand everything about in the first hour. But we wanted to see how we can take a folder with files and make that a three-dimensional experience. So we went very literal about it. We used what is called the metaphor approach to UI, UX, and interfaces, but with a bit of a twist. So you are in an elevator where you can go up and down to infinity. And in each one of these TV slots, you can save one of your files, that you produced in this application that we're working on. You can save it in here, and you can then rearrange them, because we're working on putting smart tags on them. So it's kind of like creating a map, but then, you can reorganise them so that they form a different kind of map. And what's even more interesting it's, we also tested another thing. You can go in, on this chair, and pull a file out of this slot next to this strange TV screen and throw it down into the abyss. It's like a big VHS tape that you kick outside of this chair and you can look down and see it drop. We're very interested in understanding how people react when they have to interact with abstract things like files as if they were physical objects they can throw. And this is part of a much more complex exploration that we're pursuing. This is part of the same application. <br><hr style="width:10%;"><br><center><img id="64806C17-B18A-4505-8C4C-6B281D62C631" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/554B779F-87BF-4468-A108-0CE7A627DC26.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br>This is the kind of environment you can make that you then save on the screen. And the one thing that I want to point out here is that, you basically see the scene two times. What you're seeing here is that, you are in this roof that's shown to you at one to one scale, and you also have a mini version of that roof. So you're simultaneously perceiving, quote-unquote, this fake reality inside of your headset two times. And we're experimenting with all sorts of interactions in here, because you also exist in here two times. You exist at your perceived one-to-one scale. And what we call <b>“mini-me”</b> is also in here. So there's mini you in there that you can also interact with. So we're seeing very interesting things happening because, of course, this environment, where everything is twice and there's a mini you that you can do things to, it's a very different logic of the universe than what we are used to having in physical reality. <br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><br><center><img id="AF711407-BEEA-45B8-9761-E96BC1E85D70" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/D7D4BED9-8E8D-4D6C-B25C-EAD326AD4E78.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br><b>This is a Borgesian Infinite Library based on a Penrose tile pattern.</b> We made this kind of for fun to explore the limit like the psychological limits of environments. This is actually a VR environment, but it's a bit much so when you go in, your mind starts to lose it a little bit. But we just wanted to make an environment where we observe, at what point is an environment too much, and what exactly are the psychological effects that you start to experience in the first person when that environment becomes too much. And why is it too much? Is it the repetition? Is it the modularity? What exactly makes triggers those psychological effects? <br><hr style="width:10%;"><br><center><img id="AB8E1C13-2E8C-4B6F-B289-D9C1536D6BC9" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/C8083F1F-5AA3-452E-9B92-298A662369DA.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br>And this is my last slide. This is a game that we're working on, also highly experimental, where we're putting a lot of these things that we're thinking, and reading about, and exploring. We're collecting all of this into what we call a VR testing environment that is called <b>GravityX.</b> And the motto for this is, the first line from John, but with a bit of a change. So it goes,<b> “In the beginning there was space, and the space was with God, and the space was God.”</b> So we basically replaced the word, “Word” with space in the first line from John. All right that was it. Thank you for bearing with me through this.&nbsp;<br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><br><h3 id="7D9263B4-D153-4721-9AE9-9AFE19A886BE">Q&amp;A</h3><br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/4YO-iCUHdog?t=3864">https://youtu.be/4YO-iCUHdog?t=3864</a> <br><br><b>Frode Hegland:</b>&nbsp;It was an absolute pleasure. Very, very grateful. I mean, obviously, lots of questions and dialogue now, and amazing. My initial observations, kind of, to you and to the group. First of all, thank you. And secondly, I was asked a while ago about, “Do I think the future is going up, improving? Or going worse?” And my answer was, “It seems to be diverging. Getting much better and much worse”. You're in Germany now, right? So we're dealing with a full-on war in Europe. We're dealing with horrible things in other parts of the world. And then, we have this. When I defended my viva to Claus and Nick about two weeks ago, they very rightly questioned some of my language use around mental capacities. And my defence to them was, “We just don't know enough to use hard language”. So Claus, if you don't mind taking the first half of this presentation mentally into my thesis, that would be great. What I’m trying to say with that is, if our species is to survive, we have to evolve. And we're the only species known who has a chance to have a say in our own evolution. So I think that what you have shown today is foundationally important. It was just really beautiful. We have to take this very seriously. In our group here, we call ourselves the Future of Text Lab. But we have decided that what we mean by Text is almost anything. It used to be very narrow, but because of VR, we're doing something else. And just two more comments before I open up the virtual floor here. One of them is: I believe that the most powerful thing human beings have is imagination. And imagination has an enemy, truth. A teacher, when I was in university, many years ago said, “Truth kills creativity. Because when something is something, it is something and you're not going to look at it in a different way”. We saw that with the normal, traditional desktop computing, it basically became word processing, email, web, and a few other things. A lot of the early stuff isn't there. When we today, in our community, try to make more powerful things, people say, “Huh. But that's not a word processor”. Or, “Uh. That's not that”. Because imagination has been killed by truth. It is something. A little thing that I read on New Scientist, I think two days ago, in our bodies we have this thing called fascia, which is a connective tissue that goes around all our organs. I’m mentioning it for two reasons. First of all: it is kind of like an internet for our body that's not our central nervous system. But until 2019 it was just thrown away. If you're doing a dissection, or if you're cooking a beef dinner, you would just get rid of this stuff. Because we didn't have the ability to investigate it. And again, 2019, nobody had looked at it before. And now we're realising that it has about as many nerve cells, roughly 250 million, as our skin. When you are looking at the way that our brain connects with the world, what I really liked about the way you do it, you are clearly very intelligent, but you're also very humble. Clearly we have evolved with our environment, but the implications of what that means is extremely hard for us, humans, to fathom, I think. So, I just wanted to<b> thank you very, very much for having the guts to look at this most foundational thing of what is to be human</b>. And for us to together try to use virtual reality type things to examine how that may change.<br><br><b>Andreea Ion Cojocaru:&nbsp;</b>Yes, thank you so much for saying that. Well, I think I have the guts to talk about these things because I’m an architect.<br><br><b>Bob Horn:</b>&nbsp;I’m so excited by this presentation. It's just so delightful. George Lakoff was a friend of mine and colleague. I audited his course over in Berkeley. I wrote the obituary for Varela, for the World Academy of Art and Science. <b>The whole framework in which you enmeshed us in now is wonderful, and it really excites me now to get into virtual reality.</b> I’m among the older people here in this group and I’ve resisted. Gulliver’s Travels metaphor was wonderful. I have a collection, one of the things I do is put words and images together. Visual spaces. As you can see behind me. Mostly I do it into two-dimensional murals that are 12 feet long and so forth. I actually work with the International Task Forces on this. The one behind me is the one I did on the avian flu 15 years ago. On what could have been the worst pandemic. And so, anyway in looking into into just the Gulliver thing. I mean, that I want to get off my mind. I had forgotten all about this bag of stuff. I have a bag of objects which are arrows. Which I use in these murals. I have a bag of 200 arrows. Different kinds of arrows, that have different kinds of meanings, that I would like to throw out there and give to you and see what you do with them, and see what you do with them in in virtual reality. So, anyway, I’m just filled with exciting possibilities after this. I don't want to occupy any more time, but thank you very much. It was wonderful.<br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/4YO-iCUHdog?t=4317">https://youtu.be/4YO-iCUHdog?t=4317</a> <br><br><b>Brandel Zachernuk:&nbsp;</b>Thank you. This is super exciting. And your comment on the, sort of, the&nbsp;homuncular flexibility&nbsp;and, sort of, hinting at neuroplasticity is something that I’ve definitely observed in my work. I was one of the responsible for some of the launch titles for Leap Motion. One of the things that were really fascinating for me there was having the number of degrees of freedom that one has there, and being able to just turn those things into whatever you wanted. And after a while, the contortions that one's hands were undertaking, completely disappeared. And the more simple of which was just tilting a hand, but then, amplifying that three to four times. Most people didn't realise that this angle wasn't that angle. They completely thought that their hand was down, despite the fact that that would have been anatomically impossible. So I think that we have an enormous range of opportunities available to us once we have the ability to, kind of, recruit more of our stuff. One of the first things that I wanted to talk about, or ask you about is; <b>You were pretty disparaging of the term "Illusion," which I’m in agreement with.</b> It reminds me a lot of Gerard [indistinct]’s frustration with people talking about cognitive bias and the sort of embodied situated cognition kind of things you're talking about also, prioritise cognition for a reason. So have you come across or what is your take on cognitive bias and how it relates to this, as well?<br><b>Andreea Ion Cojocaru:&nbsp;</b>Well, most of the things I’ve encountered that were referred to as cognitive bias, where bias, with respect to some kind of main understanding of cognition, but we do not agree on what the main understanding of cognition is. So I don't know from what point of view do you think that that particular thing is biased. So I don't find those conversations particularly useful, or the term itself, from the perspective of my interests. Because <b>I don't think we have that common ground or understanding that would allow us to meaningfully talk about bias.<br></b><br><b>Ken Perlin:&nbsp;</b>Everything you're saying is absolutely wonderful and resonates very strongly. And it also, in support of this, I’m thinking that there's this phenomenon that, when something becomes normal, we tend to forget that there was a time when it wasn't normal. So everyone here has had the experience of an automobile being an extension of our body. And we all read a book, which is an object that kind of didn't exist at some point. Even the fact that we wear shoes now when there was a time when people didn't wear shoes, the whole world would have seemed very strange. And obviously, phones and all these things. So it seems to me what you're talking about is kind of the next phase, or actually putting some rigour behind, a phenomenon that is because we are the creatures of language, so, therefore, we live in this world where I say the word ‘elephant’, you've got an elephant in your head. And that happened a hundred thousand years ago. We're kind of catching up in some sense to understanding what we do as a species. And I think I agree with you completely that, because of the more radical vestibular nature of, “I put on a VR headset, and now I start having these new kinds of novel mappings”. But, on the other hand, the language of cinema is something that might not have made any sense to someone before we all learned how to watch movies, and that's a completely crazy mapping, if you were not used to it, that radical point of view changes from moment to moment, but yet doesn't drive us crazy. <b>So I feel like, not only is what you're saying make a tremendous amount of sense, but it's also making sense of things that happened long before we even had computers.</b> And that's kind of what we do in a way, we just didn't kind of acknowledge it yet. And I wonder, what do you think about that?<br><b>Andreea Ion Cojocaru:&nbsp;</b>I think we're social creatures. <b>So sharing a reality is how we survive.</b> It's the kind of organism that we are. So it's important that we can share a reality, and the reality that we share cannot be the actual reality. It's just not. So we share a story about that reality. And it takes society to change the story. Individual people cannot change the story at a level that's profound or meaningful enough at all. There are these lonely people that sometimes can become important, and we call them innovators, when everything is good we call them a pain in the ass. I think now is a particularly difficult time in which we happen to need innovators. I think now things are not looking good at all in terms of where society is going and what we're doing to the planet. So I think there's a particular urgency to call the people that can shake up the story. That's also a bit the reason why I introduced the talk about subjectivity. I believe that there are two reasons why I go into these things with VR. One is because I personally believe this is a path and a methodology that gives us the most ability to understand what the technology can do. But I also think the promise of a change, in the subjectivity of a change in the story, collective story, of a change in how it feels to be human is appealing to me, because we are, at a point, where we really need that right now and we can't afford to wait. So there are two slightly different reasons why I chose to kind of go down this path. And, yes. I think all of this has happened in the past. I think the collective story controls the narrative of everything. That's why, for me, the moment VR will reach mass market is actually very important, because, right now, we're still talking about this technology being at the fringes. We have what? Half a million people? A million people in VR Chat? But I think the numbers are much less in terms of concurrent users. But where are we taking things if half of our teenagers start spending half a day as an Octopus, how do we make sense of that, and how do we take this tech to a point where we... It's like, I think that <b>if we continue to avoid a serious discussion on these mechanisms and methodology for XR developers, we will fail to have a good grasp on this technology. </b>It's a hard conversation because a lot of people, as I said, either believe that these things are illusions or do not think is part of their discipline to go into this discussion. My position is, you just don't have a choice. We just have to go this path. Or at least have a conversation and debate methodologies. Because we will be in a situation where, on one hand the whole planet is going down the drain, and on the other hand we have to put half of our teenagers in some mental institution because they spend their days as an octopus. So this is putting it extremely bluntly. I should mince my words, but sometimes I get this sense of urgency coming from these two directions. And the best I can do, with my ability to think through things, is to go as deep as I did today and try to ask these difficult, unanswerable questions, to try to prevent, perhaps, or contribute to the prevention of these two big dangers that I’m seeing.<br><b>Ken Perlin:&nbsp;</b>Thank you, yeah. <b>It will come a day when the people who get put into institutions are the ones who refuse to learn how to be an octopus.</b>â€¨<br><b>Mark Anderson:&nbsp;</b>I love this. Interesting enough, actually, it was interesting the bit about homunculus, because that actually, my understanding sort of came at a completely different angle, because I came across it in V. S. Ramachandran's book, Phantoms in The Brain, back in the late 80s, where this was about to do with neurological people with damage and how they were adapting their bodies. But, of course, it's blindingly stating the obvious, to me it says that this would map across, why would it not? Because just if you can wrap your mind around mapping your mind away from a limb you no longer have, putting a couple of extra octopus arms on isn't such a big stretch. I just come back to a couple of things that it's interesting to sort of getting your thoughts on a bit more. I was listening to your thing about the Command+Z and I was just wondering, it was hard to phrase this in a way that doesn't sound glass half empty, which isn't where I come from, but so when we bring these things back, I suppose the answer is we don't know whether we bring back good things or bad things because, in a sense, we can train ourselves to do things we do normally for not particularly societally good reasons. We train people to do things very well. And then we have problems teaching them to not do that. So I’m wondering if there's another interesting element in this as we explore it. On the one hand, potentially the gain, even the things, going back to my opening point about the neuroscience people at San Diego trying to mend broken bodies and things. But just <b>being able to effectively work through a different set of control mechanisms is really interesting. </b>So I don't know if you have any thoughts on that. And the other thing that I was interested in, when you mentioned sort of the 80/20 thing back you were also saying effectively <b>we're not using, or we don't know how we're using 80% of our neurological inputs.</b> Is it that we don't know what it's doing or we just think it's not being used?<br><b>Andreea Ion Cojocaru:&nbsp;</b>Yeah. Oh, I can clarify that. The first example of this that I’ve looked at, is actually Varela's own research. He was studying vision. And he talks about this in The Embodied Mind in 1990. He talks about how, basically, 20%... So the information is entering through the retina, the optical nerve. And the visual cortex is forming the image. So that's what our consciousness perceives as it's out the window. And Varela concluded from his own studies on vision that only 20% of the information that's coming through the optical nerve is used by the visual cortex. And there's very recent research, a few months ago, that is reinforcing that about various parts of the brain. So 20% is like, quote-unquote, actual. But actually, the thing is, the percentage, in the beginning Varela was not really believed, and there was a lot of pushback on that. They were like, “There's no way this is true”. I've recently listened to a podcast by a neuroscientist saying amazing, completely shocking things are coming out of research right now showing that 80% or more is what's called top-down influences. And she sounded completely like, “Well. But this is science, so we must believe it. But we still can't really, or really want to believe it. And it looks like there could be more than 80%”. And she was kind of shaking. Her voice was shaking as she was saying that. And I was like, Well, Varela said this 30 years ago. So there's some degree of homomorphism, but again, if you listen to other people, there's no&nbsp;homomorphism,&nbsp;there's some degree of homomorphism between the environment. <b>It is that 20% or less, the rest we're making it up. We're making it up. But it's a collective making it up.<br></b><br><b>Peter Wasilko:</b>&nbsp;I was wondering if you had any thoughts about the use of <b>forced perspective and other optical illusions in real-world architecture in order to create a more immersive environment?</b><br><b>Andreea Ion Cojocaru:&nbsp;</b>I think, in the physical world, we are experimenting with AR in creating illusions. I don't know if that's what you mean. So my example of the AR app where we create this out of body experience was a little bit like that. But for me, it's very much connected with what are we trying to achieve. And for our work, it's not immersion. I’m not very interested in immersion for its own sake. It's like, what does that mean? Does it mean you really believe that you're in VR? I don't know if that's so relevant for my interest. <b>We create illusions but only because we want to achieve a certain feeling, or emotion, or cognitive process, or trigger a certain thought process.</b> So the illusion has to be connected to that by itself just being in an environment, and thinking it's another kind of environment, or if thinking, or having the illusion that is bigger, or smaller, or just different on its own, without part of the largest strategy, is not something that we would typically pursue. I don't know if this answer your question.<br><b>Peter Wasilko:</b>&nbsp;Yeah, pretty much. I was thinking of trying to <b>design environments to achieve certain emotional cognitive effects. </b>So I think we're running in the same direction.<br><br><b>Claus Atzenbeck: </b>Yeah. First of all, thanks for this talk. I have three quick questions, I guess. So you showed one project. It was this elevator, basically, which you can use to go to some TV screens.<b> Can you say a little bit about the limitations we may face in a virtual 3D world? </b>For example, if I imagine that I have some zooming factors implemented that the user could zoom in to up to infinity, basically. This would change the perception of the room. So I would become smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and the space would just become bigger and bigger so I could, actually, have different angles. So is this something the human could still work with? Or for example, what about rooms which are of contradicting dimensions? I imagine this Harry Potter tent, for example, which is larger inside than outside. Is this something a human can actually deal with? Could a human, actually, create a mental model of, since this cannot happen in the real world? This was the first question. <br>The second one is<b> a general question about vision space, </b>VR, I mean, this is all about visuals. This is just one channel, basically, we look at. Did you think about, well, first of all, why did you pick that and not other channels which would target other senses? What do you think about multi-modality, for example? Using different senses? And also, what would be the potential, basically? When you said this Control+Z thing, I thought about the muscle memory I have for typing a password, for example. When I actually look at the keyboard, it becomes harder for me to type in the password. And if I see a keyboard which has a slightly different layout, possibly two keys would be exchanged, like the German keyboard and the U.S., American keyboard, it becomes almost impossible to type this password fast enough, because I’m kind of disturbed by the visuals. So wouldn't it make sense to actually ignore the visuals for some projects, at least, just thinking about the other senses, basically? <br>And the last question is more of a general nature. <b>Do you think it's really beneficial to try to mimic the real world within the computer? </b>Like a 3D world which almost feels like being in the real world? Or do you think we should focus on more abstract information systems which may be more efficient, for example, than using an elevator going up and down?<br><b>Andreea Ion Cojocaru:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, thank you for that. I think one and three are connected. One and three are about the elevator. The first question was; <b>could it be too much for us to deal with these infinite spaces and this shrinking and expansion of our perception of the body because it's so drastically different? Up to a point, we can definitely do it.</b> Just like the octopus. I do think we can do it. We will hit boundaries and borders, and I’m fascinated by that. So part of<b> our more experimental work is to see where those boundaries are, and what does that mean.</b> Because, yes, we have adapted for quite a while through the physical Reality with, capital R, whatever cloud of particles and radiation that is for quite a while, right? But if the people that do not believe in homomorphism are right, and mathematically so far they look like they're right, we actually have no structural coupling with what is out there. We completely make up the collective reality. But again, I’m going into speculation. Since I’m like not a scientist, I try not to speculate in public. And when I speak in public, I just focus on the papers and keep the speculation to my interpretation of the papers. Going in this direction would mean going into papers that are not commonly accepted as science. So it's a big parenthesis. I believe, assuming we have homomorphism structural coupling with Reality with capital R, I think we will hit boundaries. I think VR can quickly put us in environments that we can't deal with and will feel uncomfortable. I’m interested in exploring that boundary and have... I don't want to go beyond boundaries, I have no interest in making anyone feel uncomfortable. But I feel like we don't really know what the boundary is. So we're talking about what we think the boundary might be, without actually having a good understanding of where that is. <br>	Then, the third question was related to the chair. So I would argue that that chair is like nothing you would ever experience in reality. We're taking something that is a little bit familiar to you, which is a chair and a joystick that moves the chair up and down, but the experience and the situation are drastically different than anything you would do in reality. Because you cannot take a chair to infinity in reality. So what we were doing in that environment, people say skeuomorphic, I’m like, "What is skeuomorphic about driving a chair to infinity?" So what we were doing is, we had some variables, some things that were controlled. We couldn't have variables everywhere. We couldn't have variables on the infinite wall, and variables on the chair and what's around you, because it would have been too much. So we made the chair and the control skeuomorphic, quote-unquote, so we can experiment with the other stuff. And the fascinating thing was that, basically, that environment is just a folder with files. But just by doing this, it's stupid, the whole thing is on the infinite elevator, and the infinite wall, on a basic level is the dumbest thing, but all of a sudden, people started to get exactly the same ideas that you just got with like, "Oh. What if I go to infinity? What if I start to have the feeling that I’m shrinking or expanding?" And you do. You do start to feel like you're shrinking and expanding and you're losing your mind. People started to think, “Oh. I could have infinite scenes”. This is like, they started to ask us, “Is this the metaverse? Oh, my God! The possibilities of seeing all of my files in here”. And people got excited about something that they already have. They already have that in a folder. You could almost have, well, not infinite, but you could have more files than you would ever want in a folder running on a PC. But their minds were not going, and exploring, and feeling excitement about those possibilities. So it was interesting how, just by changing the format, like spatialising something you already have, just open up this completely different perspective. So, yeah. We call that our most spatial menu yet, because that's basically a menu. I think there is tremendous potential in this very simple, almost dumb, shift from screen-based 2D interfaces to 3D. It's dumb but for some reason no one is doing it. For some reason like, I posted this stupid elevator and some people were like, "Andreea, this is stupid. What the hell is this? Why are you doing skeuomorphism?" Because I’m known for these ideas, and known for hating skeuomorphism. And everyone saw my elevator was&nbsp;skeuomorphism&nbsp;and I’m like, “No, no, no. That's really not what we're doing”. And <b>every single VR application out there opens a 2D menu on your controller and you push buttons. And it has like 2D information.</b> So they're still browsing files and information in VR on a little 2D screen. <b>So this elevator was our attempt to put out there a truly spatial file browser. </b>And the extent to which it triggered this change in perspective over who you are, what do these files represent, who you are in relationship to them, what is the possibility, was really striking. We didn't really expect that. We almost did it as a joke. We were almost like, “Why don't we model this like 60s soviet-looking elevator and then, have an infinite wall and see what happens”. The idea with the infinite wall also came from like, I have a few pet peeves: <br>	One is like, homomorphic avatars, which I hate. <br>	The other one is the infinite horizontal plane that all the VR applications have. <br>	Why in the world do we have this infinite horizontal plane in VR? <br>	So we wanted to make an infinite vertical plane in VR. Muscle memory, yes. So the reason why we're focusing on visuals is because that's what we've been focusing on. But in the game that I mentioned, we have an entire part of the game which is called, The Dark Level. So what we're doing in the dark level is exactly what you said, which is we're exploring sound and space. You don't see anything. So basically, the VR headset is just something to cover your eyes and to get sound into your ears. That's something brand new that we're embarking in, because I agree with you, everything that I talk about is not necessarily specific to visuals, it just happens that we're just now starting to do space and sound, as opposed to space and visuals.<br><br><b>Claus Atzenbeck:&nbsp;</b>Just one more question on what you just said.<b> Do you think this infinity virtual 3D environment is something that people like because it's something new but you're not solving a particular problem? </b>Because I can imagine that we have a plain zoomable user interface like&nbsp;Jef Raskin&nbsp;did something like that, which you can zoom in and check your files on an infinite 2D space on canvas, basically, on the screen. So it's just because it's something new and people are happy to use that because it's new? So it's like a game? That's gamification, basically?<br><b>Andreea Ion Cojocaru:&nbsp;</b>There are two things we're pursuing with that. <br>	One is <b>spatial memory as opposed to semantic memory. </b>There are studies that show that spatial memory is more efficient than semantic memory. In other words, you're more likely to remember where you put something than how you named it. So we're interested in where people put things. And we don't want people to put something somewhere, this object that is their file, with the mouse. We want people to physically move their bodies to put that something there. So we're taking the file, which is an abstract thing, we're embodying it into an object in VR, and we're making people, literally, take it with this forklift, because we're just being stupid right now, with this forklift and literally putting it somewhere else. So that kind of testing of spatial versus semantic memory, I think, can only be done in this context. And I don't know of any other project that's doing it. <br>	And the second thing is, yeah, <b>just this pure idea of interacting with abstract entities as if they were embodied objects, </b>and being able to apply physical movements of the body, and moving the body through space to interact with these abstract objects. So that's kind of clashing together Lakoff with all of these other theories. It's like, you're learning how to manipulate abstract thoughts, by learning mechanisms from how the body moves to space but in a perverted kind of way, VR allows us to smash the two together. <br>	So we are, and we are just observing how it happens. So, no. At a conceptual level, we would love for people to have fun, but it is these two things that we are interested in learning more about. We have not just made it so people think it's just cool to go up and down.<br><br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>I’m going to go all the way back to that 80% stuff. That, of course, in a very real sense doesn't mean anything. I’m sitting outside now and there are our trees, and birds, and everything. And we have to talk, of course, about affordances. What these things are to me, which is interesting. I can see that there's grass over there. There's no chance and no usefulness for me to know exactly how many blades of grass, exactly what angle they are, exactly what colour level they are, etc. That is not useful information for me. So obviously, the 80% stuff is all about where in our system, information gets filtered. And how it's used. There are, of course, different levels of this, and the reason I wanted to discuss this point is, in the physical world, if there is a fox or something that may come gnarling up at me, then a certain type of shadow has information that otherwise wouldn't have information for me. <b>And it'll be very interesting to see when we start designing our environments in virtual reality, how we can choose to, more intelligently say, “This stuff is meant to be here because if it wasn't here, you would wonder why it's missing”.</b> Like a wall. You know you don't need a wall in VR. But otherwise, it would feel unbounded, literally. And here's another piece of information about this wall, which has actual meaning to you. So I’m wondering if you have any reflections on, let's call it hyper surrealist worlds, where you look out the window and you can choose to see the weather tomorrow. Some of it's kind of real and fancy, some of it is just completely insane. But that thing where some information is meant to be there, otherwise, you'd miss it. Other information has actual meaning. Thank you.<br><b>Andreea Ion Cojocaru:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, thank you for this question. I’m going to say some things now that I allow myself to say in public because I am an architect and not a cognitive scientist, so I’m not going to risk my reputation. But <b>the reason why the 80% is meaningful to me is, because it means the 80% can be changed. The 80% is the story.</b> So, again, this is kind of very out there statement, but I’m more interested in figuring out, rather than changing the environment and designing super interesting environments, and putting people in there. I’m very interested in pursuing what these research studies are implying and seeing to what extent the story can change what you see. Because the “over 80%” is the story, so if we change the story, you will not see grass anymore. Just like the way the frog cannot see a truck. Again I don't mean this quite so literally, but on the other hand, I do. On the other hand is the study that shows that if you're holding a glass with hot water, you hear different things than when you hold the glass with cold water. So the evidence is on the wall, but we are really scared of going into the implications of this. And the cognitive scientists do not risk their reputation. Some do and talk about things, but they're not exactly considered mainstream. So it is there. I mean, the study is there.&nbsp;<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Oh, yeah. And I think that's phenomenally useful, but another half of this is the issue of... I had a friend who was obsessed with cars. He would know everything. So we'd be walking down the road and he would see, at night, a taillight from behind, at an angle, and he could tell me who designs the wheels of that car. So what he saw, what was information to him, was very different from what it is for me. And looking at my son, first time I’m bringing him up today, so I need a medal. Anyway, if he has touched grass, for instance, of a certain thing, when he sees the grass, he doesn't just see lines of green. We obviously feel something with it. So along with what you're talking about, <b>I look forward to being able to put visual information that can have rich meaning for us, but in entirely new ways or something, the two literal examples.</b> That's all, and thank you very much for your answer. <br><br><b>Brandel Zachernuk:</b>&nbsp;Yeah. So you mentioned a neuroscientist. Was that <b>Lisa Feldman Barrett†? </b>Because if not then I’d love to know another one. Yes? Okay, good. Yeah, she's amazing in terms of her exposure to the way that priors are so important, in terms of what we're perceiving. So I’m glad we're on the same page there.<br><b>Andreea Ion Cojocaru:</b>&nbsp;Yes. She was recently on my Mindscape Podcast with Sean Carroll†, yeah.<br><b>Brandel Zachernuk:&nbsp;</b>So that, specifically, was on Mindscape? Okay, great. Thank you. And then, the next thing I wanted to talk about was, so I’m really glad to hear about your disinterest, potentially, and antipathy for immersiveness, for its own sake, because I share that. People who are regulars to this meeting know my hostility to the notion of story for its own sake as well. But you've also brought up being an <b>octopus.</b> So it strikes me that you would probably not consider being an octopus to be, sort of, significant in and of itself. But for <b>some kind of functional practical benefit, some cognitive change that you would expect to occur. </b>Have you played with Octopus? And what kinds of things have you observed there? Are there any signs that you do different things there as a consequence?<br><b>Andreea Ion Cojocaru:&nbsp;</b>Yeah. So I use their methods. Giuseppe Riva is a researcher from Italy who is using VR and these theories of embodiment to treat our sort of mental conditions. And he has an onboarding protocol for helping people identify with an avatar. He's using it with hominoid avatars. But I’ve used that onboarding protocol, again, on myself, these are not things I make public or ever will, but on myself. You basically tap, you use the thing from <b>the rubber hand illusion.</b> You have someone tap your actual body, and then, you program something that will tap your other body in a place that's kind of in the same place. And then, I did an experiment to see the extent to which I can embody other kinds of stuff. So this tapping helps quite a lot to go into it fast. And I like to embody spaces. <br>	And this sounds nuts, but let's talk about it<b>. I like to embody a room. </b>I like to experiment with how big I can get. And again, this is completely crazy talk, but then here we are, in 2022, with VR in the hands of teenagers. So, yeah. It happens. I mean, it's real. How fast it happens and how profound that experience is will vary from person to person. It's kind of like, some people have lucid dreams, some people can trigger out-of-body experiences and some cannot. But the mechanism is there. And the technology now is there and costs 400 bucks. Why do I do it? I’m interested in observing how I change. I’m interested in observing myself, and most particularly how I perceive physical reality afterward. So I’m trying to understand this transfer and see if I can have any kind of insight into that, then, I can phrase it in a more methodological way and start to form hypotheses. There are changes that are happening in me. I’m not at a point yet where I can talk about them with enough clarity to communicate them to other people, but they exist. <br>	And at the end of the day, I’m interested in <b>what Foucault called, ‘Technologies of Self’.</b> Because what I’m doing to myself is, I’m making myself the subject of technology of self, I’m using VR. But you can use other things that are not technically technology or not technology in the modern sense, you can use books or other kinds of things to push a change in myself that is very new. <br>	And<b> I need to understand what I’m becoming. </b>What's the possible direction of that? Because we might potentially face this happening on a global scale soon with very young people. And because scientists are so scared to talk publicly about this, they're so scared to throw things out there, because the VR developers are so scared to really go into this, we are left in a bad place right now, where we know we struggle. And I mean, I get a lot of shit for talking about these things. There's a lot of people telling me on Twitter that I’m wrong but I do think it's necessary, so I do it. <br><b>	I’m interested in how these things will change us, and what's the potential in that as well. I think it's even harmful to try to avoid it.</b> So those developers working hard not to trigger these things are harming everyone. The tech will do that anyway, so we might as well understand it and let it happen, or at least control how it happens. But we can't if we don't look at the mechanism. And I think that when these developers are talking about what they do to avoid it, they are not talking about the mechanism. They're not even trying. They're not hypothesising any mechanism that triggers them. They're kind of like band-aids, right? They're kind of like seeing something happening there and then they think it's something and trying to have local solutions for that. I don't know, did that answer your question?<br><b>Brandel Zachernuk:&nbsp;</b>Yes, absolutely. And your point about being a building I think is really thrilling. Reminds me of some stuff that <b>Terry Pratchett, in </b>Discworld,<b> </b>was a remarkably neuroplastic kind of writer. But it also reminded me of, <b>when we were talking about the channels of information that we're using to, sort of, explore and mess with, that proprioception is completely distinct from visual.</b> And to that end, the most exciting thing for me is virtual reality's capacity to impact what it is that we mean to do with our bodies, and what kind of impact that has. So it's very exciting to hear all of these things put together. Thank you.<br><br><b>Peter Wasilko:&nbsp;</b> I was wondering if you'd ever read Michael Benedict's 1991 book, <a href="http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=SABRAAAAMAAJ">Cyberspace: First Steps (Michael, 1991)</a>?<br><b>Andreea Ion Cojocaru:&nbsp;</b>I did not no. Should I?<br><b>Peter Wasilko:&nbsp;</b>Yes, you should.<b> It has very interesting presentations of abstract information spaces.</b> And one of the ideas was, to have higher dimensional space represented as multiple three-dimensional spaces that can unfold to reveal nested subspaces inside. Sort of like, you're looking at three walls of the cube, then another sub-cube could open based upon a point that was selected within the first cube representing another three dimensions of the abstract information object. Also it introduced the idea that you could be representing a physical object in a space, but the space itself could represent a query into higher dimensional space. So the point in the space would represent the query corresponding to the three dimensions that were currently displayed in the one space, and that would then, control what was being displayed in another link space. So just the most fascinating thing I’ve read in a long time. And I keep coming back to that book and encouraging everyone in our group to take a look at it. So I highly recommend it. And when you do get a chance to read, I’d be extremely interested in what your reaction is to those chapters.<br><b>Andreea Ion Cojocaru:</b>&nbsp;I want to add something quickly. So the thing that crosses my mind, which again, it's not something I just say in public, but like, why not? Because today's discussion is already going interesting places. What crossed my mind, as you describe the book which I will absolutely read, is this: so let's say, I just said that I, sometimes, like to embody an entire room. We can't understand these complex spaces and nested spaces on four-dimensional spaces and so on. But can we,<b> if we are a room? What kind of perceptual possibilities and cognitive possibilities would that open up?</b> Because, of course, if you truly believe that you are the room, your brain is in an altered state of consciousness, basically. Not in the like spiritual sense in any way, but at the cognitive of the cognitive level. So again, this is kind of wild speculation. But that's just the thought that crossed my mind.<br><br><h1 id="FC715AFA-2EE4-4BC5-9F68-C2F69A476853">Andy Campbell</h1><br><br><center><h2 id="1AFC1FF5-A3A2-4AA5-BD16-03861C8D1A58">Dreaming Methods - Creating Immersive Literary Experiences</h2><br></center><br>Dreaming Methods has “always been at pains not to place text in front of images, or beneath them or to one side, like labels on tanks at the zoo or explanatory plaques next to pictures in a gallery… we explore to read.

We’ve been producing digital fiction for over 25 years. <br>	Much of Dreaming Methods’ early work was dark in tone and highly experimental. A mix of surreal dreams and urban horror, it was published online, mainly through Adobe Flash to shift away from the then quite tight constraints of HTML. My approach was to treat text as a visual and fluid entity, to challenge the reader to the extreme, to make the structure of the stories themselves something unreliable, unstable.<br>We use a lot of the techniques that we originally developed with Flash to inform our current approach to digital fiction – especially when working in VR. <br><a href="https://dreamingmethods.com/portfolio/wallpaper">WALLPAPER</a> for example, part of a research project with Professor Alice Bell from Sheffield Hallam University called Reading Digital Fiction, is multi-layered in its approach to text. It’s an atmospheric and tense narrative with some surprising twists. <br>	The text within WALLPAPER appears on physical items within the gameworld, such as on postcards and letters to give a sense of grounding and normality, but it also has a ghostly presence: hand-written, circular, and floating like the cobwebs of memories; and as a flowing underlying texture that exists just beneath the environment’s surface. <br>	In <a href="https://dreamingmethods.com/portfolio/the-water-cave">The Water Cave</a>, an explorable VR poem about depression, a single thread of glowing text acts as an umbilical cord through the entire experience, guiding the reader/player out of the depths of the cave towards the surface, even though at times, ‘clinging to the words’ means having to submerge beneath the water.<br><a href="https://digitalfiction.co.uk/">Digital Fiction Curios</a>, which we created as part of another research project with Professor Alice Bell, is a prototype digital archive for VR that uniquely houses a selection of our old poems and stories created in Flash – a response to Flash being made redundant in 2020. <br>	Visualised in the style of a magical curiosity shop, readers/players can root around in the environment, opening cabinets, digging into boxes, examining, and reading digital fiction from as far back as 1999. One of the most fascinating elements to this project is the ability to view old work in a completely new way. Curios also offers some re-imaginings of what these poems and stories might look like had they been created using today’s technologies.<br>	Our most recent VR work, Monoliths – a collaboration with Pilot Theatre, funded by XR Stories – immerses participants in the evocative tales of three Northern women through a series of surreal and atmospheric virtual spaces. This project treads a fine line between giving the participant enough imaginative room to visualise the stories, which are told through spoken word poems, whilst also making them feel as if they are existing within them. Interactivity is gentle and stripped back; during the final sequence, standing on a rocky beach at sunset, you’re ‘handed’ small, beautiful stones to examine as the poem flows. <br>	A common thread throughout all our work is a sense of immersion – we look to create portholes into self-contained, often short-lived worlds; dream-like environments where text manifests and stories are told in all kinds of intriguing and unexpected ways. It’s taken a long time for us to develop our voice and approach – and of course, it’s still evolving. Methods of writing are changing but so are methods of reading. That’s what we’re seeing right now, through our current projects. <br><br><b>Links</b><br><br><a href="https://dreamingmethods.com/">https://dreamingmethods.com</a> <br><a href="https://dreamingmethods.com/portfolio/monoliths">https://dreamingmethods.com/portfolio/monoliths</a> <br><br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><br> <br><h1 id="14AFCEF6-BF10-4D07-B081-63ABF30F970F">Annie Murphy Paul</h1><br><br><center><h2 id="F3B01B6B-3EE7-47E7-92B3-033C8BE52678">Operationalizing the Extended Mind</h2><br></center><br>In the more than twenty years since the publication of the&nbsp;seminal paper by Andy Clark and David Chalmers titled The Extended Mind (Clark &amp; Chalmers, 1998), the idea it introduced has become an essential umbrella concept under which a variety of scientific sub-fields have gathered. Embodied cognition, situated cognition, distributed cognition: each of these takes up a particular aspect of the extended mind, investigating how our thinking is extended by our bodies, by the spaces in which we learn and work, and by our interactions with other people. Such research has not only produced new insights into the nature of human cognition; it has also generated a corpus of evidence-based methods for extending the mind. My own book—also titled The Extended Mind <a href="http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Dk-_DwAAQBAJ">(Murphy Paul, 2021)</a>—set out to operationalize Clark and Chalmers's idea. In this talk, I will discuss the project of turning a&nbsp;philosophical sally into something practically useful.&nbsp;<br><br><a href="https://anniemurphypaul.com/books/the-extended-mind/"><center>https://anniemurphypaul.com/books/the-extended-mind/</center></a><center> <br><hr style="width:10%;">  <br> <br><br></center><center><img id="A63A600C-AEFF-4B33-8254-463FB6307F4A" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/888D1920-D525-436D-927A-AC8938BE342B.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br><h1 id="6A915B40-FB1E-4E65-9FE2-FB1A516D09DD">Apurva Chitnis</h1><br><br><center><h2 id="56C35FAB-1903-4E64-A59C-C83078356509">Journal: Public Zettelkasten</h2><br></center><br>The future of knowledge management on the internet <br><center><br></center>These last few weeks I've been building my own Zettelkasten†. It’s an intimidating German word, but the idea is simple: when you’re learning something, take many small notes and link these notes to one another to create a web of connected notes. This is more effective than taking notes in a long, linear form (as you might do in Apple Notes or Evernote) because you can see the relations between ideas, which helps with your understanding and retention.<br><br><center><img id="733DC641-064E-4982-9117-A2505ECDBC5D" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/734838F4-DD97-4127-830B-A94DF2DDD46B.jpeg"></center><a href="https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125"><center><br></center></a><i><a href="https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125"><center> Zettelkasten. Clear, 2019.</center></a></i><a href="https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125"><center><br></center></a><br>The core idea behind Zettelkasten is that knowledge is interrelated — it builds off one another, so your notes — your understanding of knowledge — should be too. Wikipedia is structured in a similar way, using links between related pages, and in fact even your brain stores knowledge in a hierarchical manner†. <br><br><h3 id="A1563B5F-8D71-4956-8C64-D7EB6363F2D0">Limitations today</h3><b><br></b><br>But as powerful as they are, Zettelkastens implemented today are limited in two ways: firstly, they are only used for knowledge-work†, and secondly, they only represent knowledge in your mind, and no one else's. These limitations are debilitating to the potential of Zettelkasten, and more broadly how we communicate online.<br>	I believe that not only knowledge, but all sentiment and expression is interrelated. Further, my knowledge and sentiment is built off of other people’s knowledge and sentiment, ie it extends beyond myself.<br><br>For example:<br><li>I think that “NFTs are the future” after listening understanding “@naval’s belief that NFTs are necessary technology for the metaverse” in “this podcast”</li><br><li>I love “A Case of You” by “James Blake”, and “this is my favourite live performance”</li><br><br><h3 id="54C4855C-29B8-48D4-80A0-DE07D13C8CF0">Public Zettelkasten</h3><br><br>So what would happen if we removed these constraints? Imagine if we each built our own, individual Zettelkasten, representing our thoughts, opinions and experiences, made them public, and related our knowledge and sentiment to each other. What could we do with that? A few ideas:<br><li>We could look back in time and see how someone we admire learnt about a topic. In the first case above, we can understand why @naval believes what he does about NFTs and the metaverse. We can see what influenced him in the past and read those same sources. Further, we could then build on his ideas, and add our own ideas, for example “someone needs to build a platform for trading NFTs in the metaverse”. Others could build off of our ideas, and others could follow their journey as they learn about something new.</li><br><li>We can understand how an artist we admire created something. In the second case above, we can see when James Blake first listened to the original “A Case of You” by Joni Mitchell, what he thought and felt about it, and why he decided to perform a cover. We could use that understanding to explore Joni Mitchell’s back catalog, or be inspired to create our own content, for example by performing a cover. Followers of Joni Mitchell and James Blake could easily see our covers by following edges along the graph.</li><br><br>These are just a few ideas, but if we each made our Zettelkasten public and interrelated to one another, then there would be as many interaction patters as there are people in the world. This would unlock new forms of consumption and creation that are not possible today.<br>	This knowledge and sentiment graph could be queried and accessed in a huge number of ways to answer a broad range of questions. You could effectively upload your brain to the internet, search through it (and those of others), and build on top of everyone’s ideas and experience. This is a new way of representing knowledge and expression that goes beyond the limitations of paper and Web 2.0: it allows us to work collaboratively, in ways that Twitter, Facebook and friends just aren’t able to offer today.<br><br><h3 id="8B96C3D9-D3D5-41E8-93D5-497BA2E7E5FC">Implementation</h3><b><br></b><br>What data-layer should be used for storing this data? A blockchain is one idea: the data would be open and accessible by anyone, effectively democratising all knowledge and sentiment. It would be free of any centralised authority - you could port your knowledge in whatever application you wanted to use, and developers could build whatever UIs make most sense for the task at hand. Finally, developers could create bots that support humans in linking and connecting relevant ideas to one another — a boon for usability efficiency and discoverability.<br><br><h3 id="0C2F3B9B-5E29-44CB-80CD-82FB555E48F0">Challenges</h3><b><br></b><br>The biggest challenge with this idea, if we use the blockchain as the data-layer, is that the information a user would create is public and permanent. You may not want the world to know you believed something in the past (eg if you were a fan of X in your youth), but you cannot easily delete data on the blockchain†. You could, however, add a new note to explain that you no longer believe some idea — this would be particularly useful to any followers of yours, who now have additional context about why your opinion changed.<br>	Similarly, you'd be revealing all of a piece of knowledge or none of it; with a rudimentary implementation, you couldn't partially reveal a belief to just those you trust. Zero Knowledge Proofs might be a fruitful solution here. <br>	The second big challenge is how to present this data visually to end-users. Solving this particular challenge is outside the scope of this article, but it suffices to say that linear feeds (such as Twitter or Facebook) wouldn’t work well. If these barriers could be overcome, public Zettelkasten could not only be how we represent knowledge online, but also how we understand ourselves and each other in the future.<br><br><h1 id="F185C595-F68A-4463-B28C-21E7217C1B2C">Barbara Tversky</h1><br><br><center><h2 id="361ACC5B-DE47-4660-B437-CE18599F8579">The Future Magnifies the Past</h2></center><i><center><br></center></i><br>What is <i>text </i>anyway? It can’t be impressions in clay or ink on parchment or pixels on a screen. Those are manifestations of text. <i>Text </i>must be more abstract than any instantiation of it. Perhaps it’s meaningful groups of characters visible to the eye. But that canonical way of understanding text shuts out meaningful groups of sounds audible to the ears or meaningful patterns of dots tangible to the hands. There are many who use their ears or fingers to “read” text rather than their eyes. These are all ways to sense language. Then, is the mapping from language to text by sound, as in Western languages, or by meaning, by-passing language, as in Chinese characters that can be read by speakers of Japanese, with add-ons for sound? How about emoji? And wordless books?<br><b>	In essence, text carries thought. </b>Irrespective of the mapping, text arrays characters in space. The spacing itself is full of meaning, the spaces that separates words, sentences, paragraphs, chapters. The forms of the characters carry meaning, font size, style, and color. There are marks showing sighs and grunts and smells, common in comics. <b>Spoken language disappears quickly; meaningful groups of visible characters stay around.</b> Putting thought permanently into the world doesn’t require written language; graphics can as well. There were graphics long before writing, on walls of caves or faces of stone. They are the earliest evidence of symbolic thought, representing thought through graphics, more directly than words.<br><b>	Mapping meaning directly to graphics encounters problems.</b> Many meanings,<i> if, where, truth, yesterday</i>, <i>government</i>, don’t have clear graphic representations, a problem partly solved by adding ways to map sound. A messy mapping. Around 4000 years ago, workers speaking a Semitic language in the Eastern Mediterranean invented the alphabet, a small set of characters that represent sound directly. This efficient system was adopted and adapted by many languages. It turns out that each language has a relatively small (20-40) number of basic sounds from which a multitude of words can be created. Words and sentences can be combined in countless ways to express countless meanings. Mapping sound to characters also gets messy as readers of English know, <i>though, thought, tough, through</i>. And <i>throw </i>and <i>threw</i>.<br>	What you are reading and I am writing is not ink on a page; it’s pixels on a screen†. Pixels can form graphics of all sorts, photos, drawings, maps, charts, diagrams, graphs, cartoons, as easily as they can form meaningful groups of characters. Graphics have enormous appeal, paintings, film, TV, billboards, emojis, graphic books, symbols, Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube, TikTok. Augmented reality, and immersive virtual reality, that is, XR.<br>	Words have powers; graphics have superpowers. They inspire. They can bring joy and elation and generosity; they can evoke hatred and fear and murder. Graphics are more intricate, more vivid, more nuanced, more attractive, more emotional, and more memorable than text. Speakers of any language can readily recognize a line drawing of a happy child or a fearful attacker. Or a benign chair. A spare armless chair evokes different sensations and associations and emotions than a plush overstuffed one. True, you can imagine both and probably did as you read. Now the foreboding: people readily confuse what they read and hear with what they truly and really experience. If I ask you in a day or two did you see a picture of an overstuffed chair, some of you, especially those of you with vivid imaginations, will say yes. It is surprisingly easy to instill false memories and even easier to do it to ourselves. All the easier the more graphic the virtual. <br>	In the beginning, communication was face-to face. Words, to be sure, but also gesture, intonation, facial expressions, actions of the body. The surrounding world—pointing to things in it, arranging sticks and stones to represent things in it, drawing in the air on sand. Canonical face-to-face communication is naturally multi-modal. As is the future of text. <br>	From the distant past, a long march toward the future, releasing communication from the here and now, from canonical conversation that includes gestures, intonation, and the surrounding world through cave paintings, petroglyphs, statues, stelae, letters, books, telegraph, telephone, movies, television, computers, AR, VR, all bringing the far near, far in space or time. From rich graphics to spare characters, then onto rich graphics again. <br>	What, then is the role of text in the AR and VR worlds? There’s talk of course, but that’s not canonical text. Look around. The “real” world has plenty of text, not just in books and on screens, in the world itself, signs on street and stores, billboards. Subtitles in movies, supertitles at the opera. Live transcription on zoom. Translation, text to speech. Text can be informative, it can be necessary, it can be efficient, it can clarify. AR and VR can place all sorts of forms of text in all sorts of places, text that can be informative or entertaining.<br><b>	XR can do so much more than overcome time and place, it can create sensations and worlds that have never been experienced and that couldn’t be experienced in the “real” world. Sensations and worlds that have yet to be imagined. How perfectly wonderful. </b><br>	Or is it? The bright side is the dark side. <b>XR can depict horrors, it can arouse people to action, actions that could be horrific.</b> Just as it is hard to imagine the delights XR can bring, it is hard to imagine the horrors. “Reality” is constructed from within each of us from bits and pieces. <b>Our reality check is vividness. When the virtual is as vivid as the real, we won’t be able to tell them apart.</b><br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><center><h2 id="49FCDA2D-AF3F-4E25-BF47-0493BEC44557">Journal Guest Presentation: Mind in Motion</h2><br></center><br><a href="https://youtu.be/RydjMrG9sDg?t=714"></a><br><b><br></b><b></b><br><b></b><br><b></b><b></b><b></b><br><b></b><b></b><br><br><b></b><br><b></b><br><b></b><br><b></b><br><b></b><br><br><br><br><br><b></b><i></i><br><center><img id="3FCC59DD-31DF-4F12-9E50-572E9ED34FC0" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/ECF1820D-F57B-4BFA-BB19-1ACF531A36E5.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br><b></b><i></i><br><br><center><img id="C71685F3-EF35-4CEC-BC54-8C778E1C6003" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/AD29A955-64A1-4352-92A6-A08497DB6378.jpeg"></center><center><br><br></center><i></i><br><br><center><img id="342B7753-9EA8-4249-A1B0-13EAA78FA3B2" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/27CEECAB-9CA6-480A-BAF4-72E9C3BC14D8.jpeg"></center><center><br><br></center><br><hr style="width:10%;"><i></i><br><br><center><img id="F26D0452-15C0-473C-B2D4-5533277373E9" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/E2A2E71E-60CA-4D89-974E-278E8A698CAE.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br><br><br><i></i><br><br><center><img id="5968F42E-2992-4A89-9BC2-00770E320A1E" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/AB4A7BC0-B736-4D13-B4BF-5EC6DFD94EB1.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br><br><br><hr style="width:10%;">These are maps used by coastal Eskimos in Greenland.

“why we’re going to have to talk to each other and not bet on aliens for interesting conversations.</i><br><br>A few weeks ago I had a conversation with someone who was convinced that within our lifetime we will speak to aliens. I pointed out that while I certainly wish that he is right, if you start to do some napkin math the numbers tend to suggest that this is never going to happen. The likelihood is so close to zero that, for all practical purposes, you can assume it is zero.<br>	I was reminded of this conversation when Frode sent me a video showing what the speed of light looks like at the surface of the earth. A video of one circumnavigation of the globe at light speed.<br><br>https://youtu.be/1BTxxJr8awQ<br><br>To our senses, the globe is huge. Even just travelling from Europe to Asia or to the US drives this point home. You are hurled around the globe in a winged tube at speeds that are not that far from supersonic - and still it takes forever to get anywhere. Amsterdam to Tokyo takes about 13 hours. Amsterdam to New York is almost 9 hours.<br>	At the speed of light you can circumnavigate the equator 7.5 times in one second. To our intuition of the physical world the speed of light is immense.<br><br><h3 id="82475DF5-4812-4B21-9710-33AC17179E1D">Computers and light speed</h3><b><br></b><br>We are confronted with the fact that the speed of light isn’t particularly fast in our everyday life through computers. The most useful time-scale, if you are working with computers, is nanoseconds. For instance an integer division on an Apple M1 CPU is about 0.624 nanoseconds. The piece of code I work on right now can, according to my benchmarks, do one unit of work in about 166ns.<br>	<b>During one nanosecond, light travels about 0.3 meters (in vacuum). Or roughly one foot.</b> Which means that by the time my program has executed that one unit of the operation that I was measuring, light won’t even make it across the street to my neighbor. Imagine how much work my computer gets done in the time it would take light to travel from here in Trondheim, to New York, and back again.<br>	Jeff Dean at Google used to maintain a list of “numbers every engineer should know”. This list tells you roughly what timescale things happen at. There is a website that not only shows these numbers in relation to each other, but also shows how these numbers have changed over the last 27 years.<br><br>https://colin-scott.github.io/personal_website/research/interactive_latency.html<br><br>Notice how intercontinental packet roundtrip times have been almost constant over time. In cases that are dominated by distance, physics dictate the limits.<br>	To be fair, there are things we can do about intercontinental packet travel. It turns out that the speed of light in a fiber optic cable isn’t c (the speed of light in vacuum), but about 2/3 c.&nbsp;With satelites in Low Earth Orbit using laser interconnect in mostly vacuum, we can probably get the time to traverse the globe down a bit. But there is a hard stop at c.&nbsp;If we’re going to communicate faster we need things that only exist in somewhat exotic physics. And even then it would be “fiddly” to put it carefully.<br>	There is a video that shows the speed of light when travelling from the sun and passing the planets of our solar system. This really drives home the scale of our solar system.<br>https://youtu.be/2BmXK1eRo0Q<br>	It takes about 8 minutes and 20 seconds before we pass earth. At around 43 minutes we pass Jupiter, and as the video ends at 44 minutes and a bit it is still over half an hour until we pass Saturn.<br>	Voyager 1 has just managed to back out of our driveway. It is at present roughly 22 light hours away from earth. Which gives us the opportunity to talk about another limiting factor.<br><br><h3 id="F5BA8973-7AFF-477A-ADC9-8A84D8078197">Signal strength and distance</h3><b><br></b><br>Communicating over distances with the kinds of technologies we use usually implies using some form of electromagnetic radiation. From radio waves, through the visual spectrum to higher frequencies such as gamma radiation.<br>	The signal strength of an electromagnetic carrier decreases by the square of the distance between sender and receiver. So when you move 4 kilometers from your house, the signal strength is roughly proportional to 1/16 of the original signal strength.<br>	Remember Voyager 1, the little spacecraft that could and which has now managed to make it down our driveway and past the heliopause at the edge of our solar system? Voyager 1 has a radio that transmits at about 23 watts of power. By the time its radio signal reaches us, there isn’t much signal strength left. The signal is on the order of one attowatt - or 10^-18 watts due to the distance it has to travel.<br>	A mosquito buzzing in front of your face at a Rammstein concert is going to be very loud compared to the signal we get from Voyager 1. So in terms of our senses, this is very hard to fathom. Voyager 1 is a very faint whisper in the universe - set to a background of a lot of local noise.<br>	On wikipedia there is a page called “List of nearest terrestrial exoplanet candidates” with distances given in light years: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nearest_terrestrial_exoplanet_candidates<br>	We know that we’re capable of picking up a signal that is on the order of an attowatt. We know this because we have received signals from Voyager 1. We can probably detect weaker signals, but this becomes tricky.<br><br><h3 id="5A5FA7AD-6A74-452E-AE5B-9A8A94D36217">The Drake equation</h3><b><br></b><br>The second to last piece of the picture that really drives home the reality that while we probably aren’t alone in the universe, we will probably never speak to anyone else is the Drake Equation.<br>	The Drake Equation is described as “[…] a probabilistic argument used to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way Galaxy”. It lists a bunch of factors which it then multiplies together to arrive at an estimate. The problem is that even the intervals of these factors span vast value ranges. Have a look at the Wikipedia page for the equation to get an idea: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation<br>	Note that it only talks about our own Galaxy. The Hubble space telescope revealed about 5500 galaxies over an area that took up just one 32 millionth of the sky. Today’s estimates suggest there are about two trillion galaxies in the observable universe.<br>	But of course, the distances from “here” to “there” are so great that they aren’t even relevant candidates.<br><hr style="width:10%;"><h3 id="25B36E49-29AA-4464-B615-57574D8AE539">Our civilization</h3><b><br></b><br>Homo sapiens sapiens hasn’t been around for all that long. About 160.000 years. As hominids go, we haven’t been around for all that long. The fossil record for Homo Erectus suggests she was minding her own business for around 1.5 million years before disappearing.â€¨	We have about another 1.3 million years before we make a dent in that record - give or take.<br>	On the other hand, we have figured out multiple ways of not only causing our own extinction, but taking everything else with us in the fall. So there’s that.<br>	So where does this leave us? Well, we’re not going to be talking to aliens. We might at some point hear squaks somewhere in the electromagnetic spectrum that could be indicative of intelligent life, but by the time we discover it and get around to responding, it is unlikely the’ll even be there anymore.<br>	And we certainly aren’t going to pay them a visit unless we figure out a way to download our consciousness and somehow transmit it somewhere else – which is dubious at best. Perhaps we can create some artificial representation of ourselves.<br>	We don’t have to get into the physics of transporting a useful amount of mass a useful distance across the universe to say hello, but let’s just take it as read that the numbers aren’t with us on that. We’re thoroughly stuck here.<br>	And in all likelihood, long before talking to aliens may even becomes a real opportunity, we’re likely to wipe ourselves out. <b>Which means the only interesting conversations we’re going to have are right here.</b> On this pale blue dot. In whatever brief moments we have left before someone pushes the wrong button.<br><br><h1 id="1744F64E-BEAB-40F5-AD54-2296B299E569">Bob Horn</h1><br><br><center><h2 id="A36A19DF-70F4-4572-A50E-6F4373FEDD22">Information Murals for Virtual Reality</h2><br></center><b><br></b>I have been helping International task forces address with big challenges facing us today (e.g. climate change, sustainability, etc.) by creating large 5 x12 information murals. Some of these murals have been ported into virtual reality as examples of the complexity VR might be able to help us think better. The text used on these info-murals appears in small chunks that present interesting syntax-semantics problems for us creators and synthesizers.  When we can solve them, we may be able then to address other difficult issues such as how to manage context, how to better portray process diagrammatically, and how to improve our scaffoldings for thinking.<b><br><br></b><h3 id="4A26DCF0-AC03-47F3-8050-15A4225A7FD6">Introduction: my recent work</h3><b><br></b><br>For the past 20 some years I have been helping International task forces address some of the biggest challenges humanity faces today including global climate change sustainability, energy and resources, various aspects of the nuclear situation.

That has to do with your expectations (I imagine) as to how fast you should be able to grasp what is on one of these murals.  Rather it would be best to consider stepping back and looking for the big picture and then walking up to them and looking at individual bits of detail and how are they related. Understanding a whole mural like one of these is like reading a 50 page report. Some of your fast readers and may read them in 10 to 15 minutes.  Others will take 30 minutes or longer.<br><h3 id="9C5669B6-A0A1-4401-9DA5-BE35F6FC0977"><br><hr style="width:10%;">Why am I here at this Symposium?</h3><b><br><br>The question: </b>What am I doing here at a conference about the future of text that is mostly focused on virtual-reality?<br><b>The answer:  Information murals: </b>I got into this work of making information murals with the help of a British diplomat who saw my work and said “This will replace all those stacks of reports that sit it all the bookshelves in the foreign office which no one ever reads.  You must come to the Foreign Office and show them what you do.” He arranged it.  And my first big public work was with the British Foreign Office explaining their policies on climate change to 180 offices around the world. That was in the early 2000s.<br>	We then went on to work for four British government ministries to investigate on climate change policy.  <br><br><h3 id="BB54A760-7760-4AEF-AE0A-6C1CA8631C98">Text as idea chunks with subheads</h3><b><br></b><br>Yes, information murals are visual.  But you will see that there is lots of text on them.  You will see that all of the text on information murals is displayed in small idea chunks that are related by space, color, shape,  size, and diagrammatic elements.<br>	One of the major reformulations of text for complex subject matters will be to divide much of it into such small idea chunks. You can call them paragraphs if you like, or concept blocks, or boxes, or snippets or anything else.  <br>	The small idea chunks on info-murals consist of one to (roughly) 7 to 10 sentences or often in tight diagrammatic format, and sometimes in table, chart or graph structures. <br>	One of the next major tasks in the future of text is to learn how to manage, arrange, sequence, and display small idea chunks with informative subheads.<br><br><h3 id="16476427-D0B5-4CFB-BD6D-8F3715D5FE4C">Benefits of small idea chunks with subheads</h3><b><br></b><br>I believe these small idea chunks will eventually replace the long endless scrolls a writing that appear in academic papers and many reports in science and commerce. They will save us all immense amounts of time by enabling quick scanning and skipping of what we already know. They will help us re-use many idea chunks more easily repositioning them in different info-murals.â€¨ <b>Why am I here at this conference? – second answer<br></b>My second answer is the number of the speakers at this conference who are much more qualified to talk about virtual-reality and to make advances in it saw some of my information murals in a small workshop that Frode leads.<br>	These VR-makers immediately – that is overnight – enthusiastically put one of my information murals into virtual reality.   And in the workshop team began an intense investigation how the information murals may help us to think better about our major human problems using virtual reality.  One of the big puzzles was and is: “What is the unit or element of an information map that we should attach meta data to?”<br>	Using info-mural in VR is been very encouraging to me. I have offered to help them in any way I can because we have very large problems in front of us as a civilization and as humanity.  And we may be able to make some advances on them in VR.<br><br><h3 id="09BD55C9-EF08-45C4-A139-5A2D28FCD54A">Transition to other offerings</h3><b><br></b><br>Okay that’s what I am here.

The dialog below is from our discussion on Twitter. The video is quite hard to watch because of the constant movement, which is a great example of the power of VR: For Brandel this was a completely smooth experience and we really should experience it in VR ourselves.

But it’s nice, you know, it’s big and we can kind of navigate around it. I have this. Navigation is non-linear, so that small movements are small, but big movements result in big translations and sort of it’s proportionate to the square of the magnitude of the original motion so that we have the ability to get from one side of it to another without losing that fine detail. But now I’m zeroing out the vertical translation for the most part. This is kind of navigable with my hand at that this height. But it’s interesting. It’s really cool to be able to have these views of it and to be able to appreciate it at the size at which it’s sort of intended to be viewed at. Yeah, I’m pretty interested in it, and if necessary, obviously this information here is giving it the limits of its readability based on this particular set of pages that I’ve exported. But it, if necessary or possible, you can increase the resolution of this double edit or more or make use of some kind of adaptive display. I’m not aware of a specific PDF or at this point that would be able to pull this in natively, but a little bit of working. That’s definitely possible. Yeah, I like it. I also like this nonlinear thing. This is something that I’ve kind of made use of quite a bit in in my own work is having something that always has some action. But given that we only have a certain arm reach range, being able to kind of pinch here and then throw this way back. It’s really useful. These are one meter by one meter squares on the ground, and I don’t have arms that long, but it means that we are able to relatively fluidly and effortlessly. And if? Get into these different kind of vantage points without having to have strict changes in modality. So, yeah. Hmm. I think it’s an interesting thing to play with, and I look forward to making use of more data for this kind of visualisation in the future.”<br>Oh, it only works with the left hand - I am left-handed and also inconsiderate.<br><b>Brandel Zachernuk: </b>I got recording voice in places in VR working last night, it’s at <br><a href="https://zachernuk.neocities.org/2022/audio-record/">https://zachernuk.neocities.org/2022/audio-record/</a><br><br><hr style="width:10%;">  <br><h1 id="BE1B76FB-B5F9-4D75-BE30-996F60C4D7EC">Bob Stein</h1><br><br><center><h2 id="9D26EDE1-11E3-4A1B-8226-175B16B306D8">Journal Guest Presentation: 4 July 2022</h2><br></center><br><a href="https://youtu.be/aWK39a7a6Gs">https://youtu.be/aWK39a7a6Gs</a><br><br><b>Bob Stein: </b>So what I'm going to show you is <b>Brewster Kahle asked me to sort of think about how the archive could be more useful </b>and I got him to hire one of my colleagues from the Institute for the Future of the book, Dan Wiesel. And ee chatted for a long time and started exploring and we ended up someplace that I wasn't expecting, which was that after 40 years of elaborating linear texts, I think we have finally figured out a way. At least we're hinting at what comes next in terms of how people are organizing content and presentations.<br><br><b>Bob Stein:</b> Whenever I have a new tool, I put Vannevar Bush's as we may think into it. My colleague was a literature major, and he fell in love with Emily Dickinson. And he always starts with Emily with a favorite poem by Emily Dickinson. And so these are eight versions of the exact same poem in the Internet Archive. And these are all operating book reader windows from the archive. And you can zoom in and they all work. And this is going to be fast. I mean, it's been running through a bunch of these quickly. This is Dan's wife.<br><br><b>Recorded Kim Beeman:</b> “Hi, I'm Kim Beeman. And I'm going to talk about a few of my favorite cookbooks today.”<br><br><b>Bob Stein:</b> That's introduction she makes. She is a librarian. If I click on one of the cookbooks down here below, it opens up. There's another introduction by her. Dan put this background image and these are two versions of the of the cookbook that he found in the archive. Here we're just showing that. Let me see if I can get with this. Here, we're just showing that we can sync up an audio or video with an object. So I'm going to play this. And when she gets through a short introduction, the focus is going to shift to the First Amendment and then it would shift to the others.<br><br><b>Computer Voice:</b> “The United States Bill of Rights. The ten original Amendments to the Constitution of the United States read for LibriVox dot org. By Andrea Fiore December 27, 2007. One.”<br><br><b>Bob Stein: </b>We were trying to do a demo where we and we were look, I was looking for that famous image on of the first four nodes of the Internet, and I couldn't find it at the Internet Archive. I'm sure it's there somewhere, but their search is so terrible. But by complete accident, found this talk that Alan Kay gave in 1995 at a symposium event. You may have been there, and it's really quite a remarkable presentation of the history of computing in the sixties. And I was so excited because Alan made it very clear that the ideological basis of what was happening in the sixties was quite different than what emerged by the by the mid seventies with Microsoft and Bill Gates. And I really wanted just everybody under 50 who's working in inventing our digital future. I wanted them to watch this film, but I realized there was no way I was going to get anybody under 50 to watch a film by somebody that they had never heard of. So breaking it up into chapters and it just there was nothing out there that did what we wanted it to do. And so these are just three very short bits at the beginning. If I talk, click on the Engelbart section you get I'm sorry. I'm on a slow connection in a hotel in Birmingham, but you get Doug Engelbart's Wikipedia page, you get the mother of all demos video.<br>	You get the mother of all demos Wikipedia page, and you get the brilliant, which I'm sure all of you have seen Ted Nelson's brilliant eulogy for Engelbart.And then back to spatial data management. Voyager published this fantastic video disc that the Architecture Machine Group now the Media Lab made, and these were the liner notes for the video disk. But it's all of the early sort of greatest hit demos from the architecture machine group. And these are these four were sort of four of my favorites. This is the Aspen Movie Map. And if you'll recall, there's a point at which you can stop your the joystick, turn to the left and go into a building and explore it. Well, several weeks ago, Google showed their immersive map system and it only took them 40 years. But now they're showing people going inside of a restaurant and exploring it. And I just thought it was sort of perfect to be able to add that to the tapestry, because one of the things about tapestries, I think it's important is that the dividing line between a reader and a writer is as thin as we can possibly make it. So it's very easy for a reader of a tapestry to fork it. And as I did here, I added this video from the Google presentation. This is really an art exhibit. In 2000, we put out a tool called Tc3, which was our attempt at the time to get as close to HyperCard as we could. And we gave it to an artist who made these remarkable books that they don't run anymore, of course. But I had videos that I had made of people working through them. And so this is just a bunch of these videos and. I it just it plays but it as a curatorial tool to make this presentation and work perfectly. (Get this out of the way. Yeah. Yeah.)<br><br><b>Vint Cerf: </b>You said. Of course it doesn't run any more. Would you tell me what's missing? Is it an operating system and Apple?<br><b>Bob Stein: </b>I mean, it runs on Windows, actually perfectly. It doesn't run on the Mac anymore.<br><b>Vint Cerf: </b>Got it.<br><b>Bob Stein: </b>I mean I mean, almost everything that we did in the eighties and nineties, I mean, not almost without without exception on the Macintosh, nothing runs anymore. And almost without exception, everything does run on windows.<br><b>Vint Cerf: </b>Wow. That's actually quite an impressive observation.<br><b>Bob Stein: </b>It's an amazing thing that that they have kept this stuff going in windows.<br><br><b>Bob Stein: </b>So this is interesting. These eight windows are different for different hours of the day from a particular television station in Russia. And we wanted to show what Russians were seeing during the Ukraine war on their home televisions. And these are all so, you know, I can zoom in on these and they all play.<br><b>Computer Voice: </b>Actually. Really, I'm not in Ukraine. Um, but now.<br><b>Bob Stein: </b>What's interesting is that fast forward a little bit and this is the Internet Archive just released this. It's a visual explorer. These seven windows are seven different television stations in Russia. And these are thumbnails captured during the entire day's presentation. And any one of them, I can just click on it.<br>Here's basic. Running in in a window.<br><b>Vint Cerf: </b>Wow.<br><b>Bob Stein: </b>A programming book for kids on how to program in basic. And I was thinking, wow, wouldn't it be fantastic for a teacher to be able to give high school students the assignment of I want you to see what what computing what programming was like in 1980. So here's the assignment. Here's a place where you can do it and here's an instruction manual if you need it.<br><br><b>Kim Beeman: </b>Now, this is simply a Wayback Machine page. Got to get this out of the way. And one of the things we've done is when we when you put a Wayback Machine page into a tapestry, it comes with a with a a scrubber at the bottom. So if I want to get a different date for this website.<br><b>Vint Cerf: </b>Wow.<br><br><b>Bob Stein: </b>It's all just here. And which is pretty wonderful.<br><b>Vint Cerf: </b>This is startlingly fascinating. And I'm I'm assuming something that I want to verify. It looks almost as if each window in the tapestry is running as a virtual machine. So I have quite a base for different operating systems and different applications running within each each window. Is that a correct assumption?<br><b>Bob Stein: </b>You're probably above way above my technical pay grade at the moment. What we're I mean, each one of them is is basically iframes.<br><b>Vint Cerf: </b>Okay.<br><br><b>Bob Stein: </b>So I don't I don't think there's anything conceptually about what you're saying that couldn't be true. In other words, could I be running Parallels in a window here if I want? Maybe. I suppose I could.<br><b>Vint Cerf: </b>Well, if we could make it work that way, if these were really VMs, then you just showed a way of hanging on to old software and old content.<br><b>Bob Stein: </b>I think that I think that's certainly that would be a goal. I mean I mean, it's not we're not there. That's not what I'm showing you right now. But I think in terms of getting there, absolutely. That's the intent.<br><b>Vint Cerf: </b>That would be nothing short of spectacular.<br><b>Bob Stein: </b>Good.<br><br><b>Bob Stein: </b>So this is another piece based on the book blog post. And if you'll remember, there was this point around 2005 when Jaron wrote this terrible essay about why he hated the Wikipedia. And a whole lot of us wrote in response to it.<br>https://web.archive.org/web/20200801071657/http://futureofthebook.org/blog/2006/06/08/shirky_and_others_respond_to_l/<br><b>Bob Stein: </b>And I was looking at this at this blog post, and I was realizing that all this blog posts really was was is a an annotated guide to a bunch of Web links. And I thought it would be interesting because we could do it in a tapestry of turning it inside out. And instead of just functioning, instead of featuring our annotation to a list of web links, why not just put the links themselves live into a tapestry? So you have here's Darren's original essay, and all the other essays that are referred to are all here now. We think that the tapestries are hinting at least a new media type, but in order for it to be a new media type, it has to be portable. It can't just sort of live only at the Internet Archive. So what's interesting is that if I add the word 'embed' here. It's going to take me to a page. Where... I'm going to change the width here. (1792) And then I'm going to grab this HTML and I'm going to go to. This dashboard. This is just a WordPress blog that I've got and I'm going to make a new post. And 'demo tapestry'. Demo for future of the book or whatever. I think I got that wrong. But text, future of text.There we go.And then I'm going to put in. The custom Html. And. I'm going to go up here and preview and a new tab. And it's going to take that tapestry and it's going to embed it into. This blog post. And this is all this is all operating. And so at least showing the concept of. Of portability. And there's one more thing to show you, which is that.<br><b>Vint Cerf: </b>So in this particular case, what has actually happened, what has been imported into the Web page that you just created?<br><b>Bob Stein: </b>So the tapestries, as you see them, are simply a collection of URLs. I frames that so that each one of these windows. It calls a URL from the Internet Archive.<br><b>Vint Cerf: </b>Okay. Okay. Wow. I could call it from anywhere but in this case. Exactly.<br><br><b>Bob Stein: </b>Exactly. And I believe, for example, when the the tapestry that the Ted Nelson YouTube video. I don't know that that tapestry actually. I don't think we had to import that video into the Internet Archive. I think we're just grabbing for Wikipedia and YouTube both. I think we can just grab the URL. So here's the last one. One of the things that is that we're able to take a collection, which is what from the Internet archive and imported automatically into a tapestry. And this happened to be a collection of Atari magazines. And I was just playing around and I imported it. And so these are all active windows, and each one of these is a different magazine. And when I saw this, I got really excited because I realized that in some ways what was happening was that I was. Let me go back to the. Don't die on me now. Go ahead. Just go back. We said that I was. No. Sorry. I hate to screw everything up at the end. Anyway, that that this started to feel like going back into the stacks.<br>	What we have what we've learned with these tapestries at this point is that. Having all of these objects operating in the same visual field is way more different than we expected. That seems to reduce friction for the reader dramatically. I mean, if you think of something like this, that. Oh, it's fine. Let me go back to one of these. Yeah, something like this, where instead of having to go somewhere, every time I click on one of these things and come back like you do on the web and you. So you have to think all the time, do I want to explore? Is it worth clicking on this? How do we get everything visual at once, visible and once starts to make a very big difference that makes it makes the reader encourages the reader to explore more. And so when I saw the Atari magazines all together, I realized it started to feel like being in the stacks again, where all the books are sitting on the shelf and you just sit there and you pick them off serendipitously, one after another. And the cost of opening up another book is so low compared to what it's been on the Internet. So this is an interesting shift that we're seeing. So I'm going to step yeah.<br><br><b>Vint Cerf: </b>It's been, actually I think there's something more powerful happening beyond the stacks metaphor and that's context preservation. What's what's happening in the tapestry is that it is preserving a substantial degree of context for the user. Exactly. That's a strikingly powerful notion. I've never seen it illustrated quite so with such facility. This is really fascinating. Have you published anything at this point?<br><b>Bob Stein: </b>No.<br><b>Vint Cerf: </b>Wow. There's one other odd coincidence. There is a company which got started about a year ago called V Tapestry. Lowercase v. Capital t. It was started by a woman who does. Montages in the course of conferences. You have somebody with a giant canvas and people are talking and they illustrate what was being said. And so she does these things one after the other. Sometimes it could be a dozen or more of these very big canvases reflecting what was discussed and with lots of symbolism. She's automated this process, and so Tapestry is a company that will take the incoming text of the discussions and generate imagery to automate the process. It's quite different from.<br><br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>Bob, thank you very, very much. Really good to see this. I'm going to go back to the other window because that's my notes. You say that it's way more different than you expected. And I know that you obviously have experience with VR going way back and to different degrees, and I only became converted by Brandel in January. Before that, I'd actively stayed away from it because the future of text was a specific focus and then I decided to branch out. Now, obviously, what you're working on here would be tremendous to have wall size. Bob Horne often joins our community and he is all about murals, as you know. And one of the things that was really shocking to me is that Brandel took one of his murals, built a little, relatively speaking, Brandel a little app for it where all you can do is stand in a room. There's nothing but the mural. A mural is really big, but you pinch to move it away from you and move it towards you. So there's no walking so that you don't get sick or anything like that and you can move it sideways. That's all you can do. It's just incredibly powerful. Because yeah, it's almost undescribable how powerful it is considering there's nothing there. So I can imagine what you're working on here. First of all, obviously on the wall, but if this was even a normal kind of office room, because when you talk about preserving contexts that I could imagine that you literally keep one wall for work, one for a specific project, the one in front of you for something else. Because everybody talks about this. What I'm saying is obvious. aBut what was so amazing to see today is all the aliveness that comes through it.<br><br><b>Bob Stein: </b>Yeah. You know, I didn't use the phrase that I should have is that tapestries are infinite canvases, so they can go on forever. At which point you need some form of zoomable UI. You need to be able to. You need to be able to fly around in there and zoom in on something and expand it.<br><br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>Oh, that was the other thing I wanted to praise that you showed when you clicked on a thing it became <b>‘full screen’.</b><br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>That is so important. When I worked with someone on the Chinese website for the NBA, the American NBA in China. We built a version of hyper worlds where you can click on a player's name and you get a little bit of stats and you would click on that and we'd go big. She wanted it to be semi-transparent and smaller, and now that's been arguing with her. That's when I realized that if you're looking at something, make it big, because that's what you're looking at. Make it quick to go small again. But here, you know, you didn't play it with a little bit of this and that. I was just so relaxing on the AI. Thank you, Brandel.<br><br><b>Brandel Zachernuk: </b>Amazing work, really exciting. One question is, if you are browsing the same tapestry in multiple windows, <b>is there there would be a facility for synchronizing them</b>, more aspects of them. Is that something that you've considered in terms of either the maintenance of sort of view state or the or in order to be able to use multiple sort of nominal windows, be they real or virtual, to be able to synchronize sort of views over things?<br><b>Bob Stein: </b>Nope. Really interesting, though. I mean, I think that we just sought to answer that partially by going back to what Frode said, which is that I think what somebody asked me, so how long does this take you to do? And I said, Well, it's either three months or 40 years. There's nothing technically very interesting yet about what we've done. Right. But it's conceptual. I mean, I was showing this to somebody the other day to Howard Besser. I don't know if, you know, he's an archivist at NYU. And Howard was Howard was saying, oh, my God, this is the stuff that we imagined 40 years ago that we would do someday. And now and what's happened is that the Internet has gotten so much more powerful that things that we could only imagine back in the pre-Internet days, but we we couldn't do once once the Internet took over in terms of electronic sort of expression, we had we had to really reduce our sense of what was possible. But now the Internet, the Web has gotten so much more so much better that we're suddenly we're able to do things that we forgot we were interested in, in a way.<br><br><b>Brandel Zachernuk: </b>Yeah. Another question that I have for observation is one, obviously, in assuming using a user interface, your documents need to sort of withstand a lot of zooming. Does that does that direct and guide your sense of which which documents work? Well, you know, like you have you have YouTube videos and archive.org videos that have star frames that are or frames that are representative at some level of them, that that can do sort of once not all content on the Internet is so well kind of entitled or predisposed to being being able to kind of zoom like that deel like there's anything that can be done to help it in terms of having having those things be different sizes or or do have you put signposting that is something other than the the documents themselves inside these type of stress to support that.<br><b>Bob Stein: </b>Signposting. Yes. I mean, those are I mean, we are able I mean, just in terms of it goes back to to Vint's comments. I mean, let me... First of all, let me try this. One of the things that were the key thing that got us where we got to was that when we were working on the Alan Kay videos and showing and there were all these objects and ideas that we wanted to put together, Dan was reading Merlin Sheldrake book on the communication that goes on with fungi in the forest. And Dan said well suppose we actually thought for a minute about the fact that the objects in the Internet Archive are like trees.<b> They're the nodes. But suppose the connections between the trees had had as much, or at least the important information that showing the connections between objects is actually crucially important. </b>And that was how we really ended up with tapestries and the Brandel. Both of the things you've asked, you've you've asked we haven't thought about, you know, we're it's so early, but that's why I like showing it to the smart people, because they, you know, they start to raise questions that show us where we have to go.<br><br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>Well, Bob, that's why you need to come back. We're here same time every Friday. Every Monday, except for last week when we had our projects. I see your hand, Peter, but I just wanted to do my little standing up on a soapbox for a few seconds, because you made such a really important point there, Bob, about this is what we dreamt about 40 odd years ago and why hasn't it happened? It's not just because the Internet is more powerful and computers more powerful, although, of course, that's useful. It's also because you did it. It's really important. So in both paying you a compliment and I'm really trying to highlight the fact that commercial pressures are one thing what can augment is another thing. And the reason our little group here is now 99% focused on VR is because we're going to go into the same situation. You know, I feel almost like badly fired, you know, original Mac people and all of that stuff. There's an excitement now and that's all nice. It makes me feel very youthful. But what I really, really fear is if that if there isn't a user, an academic community that is saying the stuff that you are saying, it's like these are the things we can use to augment how we work. It's only going to be How can Apple make more money? How can Facebook Sushmita make more money? And that's totally fine. There's nothing wrong with commercial development, but what you've done, as you said, technically it isn't the miracle. The miracle is that you're paid in the effort and you're not making it available. Right. So when it comes to VR, right now, we have this beautiful oh, it's exciting and new. But in a few years, I think we're going to be where we've been for the last 30 years in Flatland. You know, there's so many things that can be done, but the market forces are so powerfully doing, you know, Macintosh pages and Microsoft Office. Where is the Bob Stein innovation going to fit in that? Right. So that is why we're fighting and that's why this future of text this year will be how can we work? And we are. Over to Peter.<br><br><b>Peter Wasilko: </b>Okay. I was wondering if you'd given any thought to<b> multi user scenarios</b> so that you could be looking at a tapestry on your machine, but have that synched with the tapestry on my machine so we could have multiple cursors visible on the screen at the same time, and we could have mixed initiative and exploring together.<br><b>Bob Stein: </b>That is certainly something that we imagine we will get to. I mean, what I'm showing you today is simply a proof of concept. We are we have to build this on the on the on the other hand, what used to take millions of dollars and years, we now are quite confident we can do a 1.0 version for in in months for hundreds of thousands of dollars. But it's you know, it's going to grow. I mean, you know, and who knows? Our version of tapestries may not be the one that grows. I think that's you know, it will happen and and it will be multi user and it will be collaborative.<br><b>Vint Cerf: </b>It's been again just I had written down the multi user question, Peter, so thank you for for asking it. Our experience with multi user documents at Google has been very powerful and for small groups of people. If you imagine, however, that a tapestry is broadly available to tens of millions of people, you would not want to have state information for 10 million people all dicking around with the same document. So you can immediately see the need for some kind of data structures that would isolate the behaviour of a group against this background tapestry without interfering with other people who might be interacting with the tapestry. So it's an interesting challenge because the current implementation, the object contains the state information in our implementation of Google Docs.<br><b>Bob Stein: </b>Our assumption is that tapestries there is there's the there's the understanding that if you want to be in a tapestry with somebody else, you have to give each other permission. And you're in that instance of that tapestry. And if you decide to fork it, you fork it for whoever is for yourselves and not for everybody else, obviously. I mean, we we dealt with a lot of these questions when we were doing social book where which never didn't, didn't come to market. But, but this idea of, of people reading together and annotating something together and how you could do that as a group and not screw up other people's experience. Although where we went with social book, which I think was important, was that if the if the permissions were in place, I might be reading a book with with Vin. And our annotations, if we made them public, would be available to other people as well. They could basically click on a community tab and see everybody's comments. But anyway, the social experience of of documents, I think, I mean, Google Docs has sort of been by far the most successful example of that. But I and anything less than that isn't good enough at this point.<br><br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>A hugely important underlying thing here is and I'm going to start with Web and go backwards is the infrastructure because also one of my I have two fears about the near future. One of them is we're going to run out of imagination in terms of the audience, just like Doug and other people, that amazing things in the sixties and then eighties and nineties. Desktop PC was defined at being specific things. Imagination went out the window. That's going to happen to VR. But the other thing that I'm really concerned about is you go into VR an environment, you create an artifact, a connected artifact, you go to another environment by another vendor and you either can't open it, which would be absolutely insane. Just like a word file in the olden days, right? So what I'm saying, you are contributing here is an infrastructure for how you thread these things together. So I think that, yes, this is really nice to see on a traditional display, but I think that with real support this and of course what we're working on with visual mata a few things to allow you to go in, do amazing stuff, whether it's 2D, 3D, whatever, and then go somewhere else will be so important. I am so scared. I mean, I love and adore Brandel. I'm a mac user fanboy and I'm really scared that when Apple comes out with their headset, whatever formats they decide are the initial ones, it's going to be cemented in reality forever. We need to scream and say these are the useful and open ones. I think that's one of the reasons, it's so amazing to see what you're doing because it's not static.<b> It's so dynamic.</b><br><br><b>Peter Wasilko: </b>Okay. I was wondering if you'd ever seen the<b> Chat Circle's user interface. </b>I'm dropping it into the chat now. That was an MIT Media Lab project that dealt very nicely with dealing with groups of people interacting in the same space. And it used a. Basically a large spatial plane representing each person in a space as a circle. And you could move around and you'd be able to hear people who are within a certain radius of your location, but you'd also be able to see the circles of people further away twitching. So you could get a sense of where there were clusters of people and that overlay that on your system to provide an interface for managing the large numbers of people, potentially interacting in the same tapestry. So you can sort of think of they'd be in different phases and you'd be able to see that there are other people who are out of phase with you and bring yourself into phase with their conversations very fluidly.<br><br><b>Brandel Zachernuk: </b>I'm curious so about sort of<b> the authoring picture</b> and and more broadly, the way in which you feel so based on the sort of the arrangement of the tapestry that you have so far. They seem like they're fairly canonical and durable in so far as you would you could point to this tapestry or that tapestry. And so that there's a rationale to have them existing as a as a as a distinct artifact that is intentionally constructed and delineated so that this is the end of the tapestry, this is what it is. And so, one, I'd be really interested in sort of the current state of authoring as you sort of have it, as you desire it and all as well, whether whether there's room to to pull on the thread, pardon the pun, of that, that continuity of it, you know, how intentionally it needs to be created versus what other options exist in that sort of space.<br><b>Bob Stein: </b>Well, first of all, I mean, our assumption is that version 1.0 will you'll you'll simply be dragging and dropping from a from a folder of of objects onto a onto the field. I mean, right now it's clunkier than that, but it will be very simple to drag and drop and assemble it as you want. And when you, quote, publish a tapestry, it is frozen. But as I was trying to say earlier, that it's very easy for a reader to push a button and, in effect, fork the tapestry and either add things or rearrange things as as suits her and can publish or not publish, etc..<br>	I mean, I think everybody here will understand what I mean when I'm saying this. I think that for me, I'm not a programmer. But<b> when we had the prerelease version of HyperCard, when it was called Wild Card, and suddenly I was able to hook up a video disc player to a computer and I could start to make things that were had value without being a programmer. </b>So HyperCard sort of became and then my, my son, who's now an engineer at Google, you know, cut his teeth on HyperCard. And so I it killed me when when jobs killed that. And Tapestry's in some ways is our attempt to go back to a time when there were tools for teachers and students to start to make things that had value and currency. I mean, it's ridiculous that we haven't had anything as good as HyperCard in all these years, and that's sort of where conceptually I'm starting from. You know, the tapestries need to have hyper talk of some sort. You need to be able to have an event statement in a tapestry. We'll get there. I but that's I think that's where we're that's where where our focus is at the moment. But it's back to your your question statement. Several people have, when I've shown them this, gone a direction that in some ways, thankfully, none of you have gone yet. Which is, So can can this can this be hooked up to AI in a way that I, I give I give it I give a subject matter and the tapestry is automatically built from. And the answer in my mind is always, Yeah, I imagine we could do that. But that's sort of not where I'm starting from.<br><br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>And so Mark and I spent the last week at the hypertext conference and two relevant things came up again and again. It's. Spatial hypertext is one. This is related to that. Why hasn't it been invested in. And also the kind of basic programming you're talking about now, if you're going to have a proper hypertext environment, you need to be able to have clever links that have a little bit of fun and have a little bit of knowledge of previous stuff. So to have like a hyper talk thing now is not going against what you said about not being a programmer, even though it could obviously sound like that. I think it's really, really crucial to enable users to be able to do some basic scripting without having to go whole hog to write this much code to initialize before they can decide what they're going to write below. Anyway, that's just me.<br><b>Mark Anderson: </b>I was just wondering, looking at the tapestries and seeing that. So you showed us a number of interesting sort of set ups there, and some were in a central grids and some of them had a bit more of a theme versus a narrative structure to them. Do you do you capture the… I'm trying to avoid the word link, but for the intentionality of placing this thing alongside that thing. And I say that with there's no hidden question in that. I'm just I'm just thinking of the fact that if I put, say two things together within the same tapestry, I'm doing it with some intent. And that's worth capturing at some point, both perhaps for me, for my future self, or for someone whom I wish to inform by the tapestry making.<br><b>Bob Stein: </b>The best way to answer that, I think, is that one thing that's driven all of my workAll this time has been that when you make an authoring tool that it's important not to restrict a single pixel. In other words if I if I, <b>if I'm really going to empower people to make things, then I have to allow them to decide what goes on, what page,</b> where what goes into what visual field, where. Because it's a very slippery road. Once you start to restrict pixels, you end up in a in a different place.<br><br><b>Mark Anderson: </b>I just I'm perhaps thinking of I see that. And I called with it. I was thinking more than just a sense of understanding that how I when I view your tapestry and understand the relationship between the first box and any other box that might be in there.<br><b>Bob Stein:</b> I think that's up to the tapestry maker. In other words, if the connections between objects in the tapestry can be made in lots of different ways, it can be made with arrows, it can be made with contextual text, it can be made by the placement of two things next to each other. I mean, there are so many ways of doing it. And you know, hopefully when tapestries come out into the world, whoever does it, there's going to be a lot of exploration at first of people discovering new ways to put things together.<br>	And you know, I'm pretty excited to see what my grandchildren do with tapestries. It won't be the same thing. I'm hoping it's far enough away from from linear, from the linearity of text that they will get someplace interesting. And I, you know, I, I, I do think we will be most tapestries will be looked at in three dimensional heads, whether it's some X, some form of X or, you know, not at first. At first we're going to be on our computer screens. But that will change.<br><b>Mark Anderson: </b>Yeah, well, that's good. It's good to hear your point about it, not just being a matter of handing it all over to I. Not that's not the iceberg thing per se, but the idea that it should be doing everything is is potentially horrifying. So thanks. I'll see to.<br><br><b>Bob Stein: </b>Well. Thank you, everybody. I really appreciate the opportunity and very there's a lot of I looking forward to having the video of this so I can go back and get each one of these questions and really think them through.<br><b>Vint Cerf: </b>This is pretty amazing. <b>In an hour or less you managed to essentially upend a lot of people's thinking.</b> Mine certainly just one thing which strikes me as being extraordinary about this whole design. And it harks back to the basic architecture of the World Wide Web. The entire structure that you've described is deeply dependent on reference and resolution. In the sense that tapestry is this collection of references and the fact that the references have to be resolved opens up this wonderful indirection. Because the resolution could change over time. If you had huge demand for something, maybe you turned it into a reference later because you couldn't serve up all the video from one website, all those things. This is this fact that it is there's indirectness and resolution involved in this. Then the tapestry itself is just a collection of references. In fact, it's amazingly powerful when you think about the compactness of the tapestry relative to the content that it presents.<br><br><b>Brandel Zachernuk: </b>I really love... My last question. My my last question is it's hopefully a good thing to put a bow on that. So first of all, this is amazing. What's next? And then second and related is what do you want from other people, including and most importantly, perhaps us?<br><b>Bob Stein: </b>I'm going to think of a good ask. I mean, we're I'm I'm so pleased by your collective response. I'd like to think of a really good answer to that question.<br><br><b>Peter Wasilko: </b>Yes. I just wanted to come out. How much? I liked the observations about the need to embed systems so they'd be available and how it's impossible to run old Mac software. And putting on my lawyer hat. I think a big problem is everyone is afraid of the licensing issues on the core roms for old platforms and Congress could really fix this if they just pass a clear bill. It could be a one pager that simply says for purposes of fair use, if the rom of an obsolete computing system is not available, copying and reproducing that ROM and making it available to people until such time as the current owner of the IP makes it available in a commercial form, shall be deemed fair use and just put that in the law one page bill. They can have it worked through in an afternoon and it would solve so much of this difficulty. I found wonderful Mac emulator systems, but they would require me to be able to boot my old broken Mac that I had a license to the ROM and to be able to get the data on the ROM off, which I can't do because the old machine is broken. So even though I'm legally licensed, even under the current intellectual property scheme to be able to access that or on my physically can't access it and no one is willing to share them on line because they're afraid of a lawsuit by Apple or some other mega corp coming after them. And it can be fixed very easily. Just declare fair use to reproduce ROMS of obsolete hardware.<br><br><h3 id="6E948AB2-C3CB-4958-9432-CAF67119E307"><br><hr style="width:10%;">Screenshots</h3><br><br><center><img id="11085231-1852-4921-91E5-3107CC1FA6CB" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/B60CB066-733A-446D-B20B-9831F3A28237.jpeg"></center><center><br><br></center><br><center><img id="F71C5346-3AAD-408B-9121-3E76F6840EBE" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/8CEC3C7B-66EB-4246-9ECB-70480992A741.jpeg"></center><center><br><br></center><br><br><center><img id="15558582-B6D6-4C84-97D7-619F430773F3" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/BC74AF4A-CAC0-419E-9954-E093432D5EC1.jpeg"></center><center><br><br></center><br><center><img id="C866AA4C-8E88-470A-8A45-3D08BCD0C2BA" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/CD98028C-8202-4B97-8B26-B3EDCFB803AF.jpeg"></center><center><br><br></center><h1 id="CFF6E41E-E8EB-47E5-98DB-2B81DA576E7C">Brett Jackson</h1><br><br><center><h2 id="5E58C805-0C05-4C7B-9C35-7BD9EB0DAECA">The evolution of mind maps for interactive VR experiences</h2><br></center><br>Mind maps are commonly used to express ideas and relationships. Bringing the concept into VR felt like a natural progression, providing an abundance of three dimensional space to arrange your structures. The more I explored the concept, the more possibilities began to unfold. Idea Engine is a work in progress that leans into the strengths of VR and mind mapping to convey and experience information and narratives.<br><br><h3 id="464B773A-EFDE-49A7-8AB4-C9D32902CD99">Why text plays an important role</h3><br><br>A page of text affords me the opportunity to absorb information at my own pace, easily adding a pause where ideas need time to settle and skimming over less interesting facts. A short rewind, when required, is effortless and instant. Ideas and imagery come to mind and help to cement new learning as I actively engage with the words, eyes scanning, and attention focussed. 	Text is the most readily available creative tool and can elicit strong mental imagery so it was important to enable and encourage its use in Idea Engine.&nbsp;<br><br><h3 id="F8EC0954-62FE-44C1-8F14-F400344B8C06">Idea Engine</h3><br><br>The aim of Idea Engine is to inspire more people to share their story. It has to be easy to use and allow many forms of creativity to be showcased. My focus is on enabling immersive experiences that are more interactive than a book and more narrative driven than a game.<br>	Idea Engine consists of nodes, optionally connected by relationship lines which may be visible or hidden. Nodes denoted as children can be set to move with their parents or be&nbsp; controlled independently. A node has one or more states with each state having its own display type, position, colour, text blocks and interactivity settings (can you grab / take it). The display types are: 3d models, images, icons or text heading.<br>	Text blocks are attached to nodes and configured to be shown for one or more states. This allows text to change in response to user interactions and then be combined into a final paginated form.<br><br><h3 id="9989020D-EC68-45A4-A775-611425F48B87">Interactivity is the key</h3><br><br>You can quickly surround yourself in VR with visual mind maps using various display types and convey complex ideas or scenes, but it’s when you add interactivity that the scene comes to life.<br>	Nodes have a default state and can be initially visible or hidden. You could start with a single visible node to draw the user's attention and explain your scenario. We can interact with the node in various ways. Just looking at the node can fire an event, as well as touching it with your hand, head or another node or by grabbing it. You can add a button for the user to press and explicitly fire an event or you can evaluate a formula to fire an event when certain conditions are met.<br>	Events cause high-level scripts to execute. Commonly used functions in a script will play audio effects or change a node’s visibility or state, thereby affecting it’s appearance or behaviour. I could talk at length about the technical features, but to appreciate the potential of the idea it’s probably more efficient to give you a small sample scene.<br><br><h3 id="23616B63-D24F-4072-AB52-0CFB7F2A0382">Your story</h3><br><br>Gentle music plays while a doorway fades into view in front of you (a node). A button press (raises an event) pops up a page of text that describes your environment and the ornate door. You’re informed the door is locked. You look around the room (now populated with more nodes as a consequence of your button press) and physically walk to a desk and find a key (a node). You pick up the key and place it into the keyhole in the door. You hear a click (an overlap event has fired, changing the state of the door node) and the textual description of the door changes to say it’s unlocked.&nbsp;<br>	You interact with a few more objects, learning more background to the story. An icon offers you the option to climb out of the window, but you choose to grab the handle of the door (grab event) and are instantly taken to a new location with a new set of nodes.<br><br><h3 id="2B0CE97D-4675-479C-99A3-FC3D79C1C289">Highlights</h3><br><br>Importantly, nodes may be revealed as required to control the flow of the narrative. Users progress by interacting with the experience, creating their own non-linear path. It’s easy to create branched narratives.<br>	The author can present a hierarchy of related information and the user decides how deeply they want to go. Maybe they will seek out every grain of background story or move on more quickly when time or their interest is limited.<br>	Nodes may be placed around the virtual environment, requiring physical movement as though being in the scene, adding to a sense of immersion.<br>	Idea Engine also has variables and inventory systems so you can keep track of what a user has achieved or require them to bring an object to overcome a later obstacle.<br><br><h3 id="04E73E86-BA71-4284-838E-1D7E86BCC480">Resources</h3><br><br>The scene may be quite abstract, leaving much to the imagination. 3D models may be used for hero objects where you want to see and understand every detail. Other objects could be described with a pencil sketch or a photo uploaded from the author’s mobile phone with an optional button giving a detailed description. Some nodes may just use a textual label or icon. It all comes down to what resources the author has, or is able to create, and how they want to present their story.<br><br><h3 id="2ECC6CC1-82B8-4921-968D-49ACA5CB7C9C">Sourcing content</h3><br><br>There are thousands of pieces of freely available content online that can be used to build your story. You can import 3D models with inbuilt animations, music and audio recordings for sound effects, equirectangular images that fully surround you and other images for objects. You can use AI art to turn text into images and help inspire you further. Hundreds of inbuilt icons can also be used.<br>	Rather than kitbashing your project, you may want to present your own talents. You can record your voice from within Idea Engine for speech and sound effects or easily import photos and text from your phone or computer.<br><br><h3 id="1E0EA77C-4707-4E19-9A59-2A43082C9A3B">VR-specific considerations</h3><br><br>The immersive nature of VR draws the user into the story, giving them a true appreciation of scale while detaching them from distractions. Idea Engine allows each location to have its own music, background imagery and lighting to help further set the mood.<br>	We sometimes need to direct the user’s attention in these 360 degree experiences. Spatial sounds can help turn a head to face the origin of the sound. Idea Engine can also animate the appearance of relationship lines between nodes to guide the user’s gaze.<br>	Viewing block-text generally occurs after getting close to an object and clicking a button. This puts you in an optimal position to read the text with clarity. It’s important to allow users to grab the text and move it to a comfortable position to read. Text gradually fades out if you move away from it, otherwise.you will soon observe ugly artefacts as it becomes unreadable.<br>	Bulk text editing is implemented as per a mobile phone, including finger-based highlighting cut and paste etc. At the moment, I wouldn’t expect people to type large volumes of text while wearing a VR headset. Comfort needs to improve, virtual keyboards only suffice for short text entry and physical keyboards can be more difficult to use even if passthrough cameras make it possible. I recommend users type the text for their stories on their preferred device. They can then connect to Idea Engine via a web browser and simply cut and paste text into the appropriate nodes. We don’t have to force everything into VR.<br>	Laser pointers are not used in Idea Engine. You reach out and interact with the world using hand tracking or tracked controllers. I believe that seeing and using your hands in VR provides the most immersive and intuitive approach to interactivity.<br>	There is no point in having a blank back side to a user interface so buttons and text appear on whichever side you happen to be looking at. This is an example of divorcing our thinking from real-world restrictions and making the most of VR.<br>	Finally, this can be a shared experience, capitalising on another strength of VR. Maybe you will venture down different paths and update each other from afar, or read passages to each other and discuss your thoughts.&nbsp;<br>	Idea Engine is a tool with many potential applications, from helping users navigate and understand complex ideas, building training scenarios to test and evaluate employees, to creating interactive games and novels. I hope it inspires creativity and helps to bring immersive experiences to life. <br><br>You can keep up to date with my progress on Idea Engine at <a href="https://twitter.com/JumbliVR">https://twitter.com/JumbliVR</a><br><br><h1 id="1DB5EBF1-8CF8-4AA2-B7A3-69652BD270CE">Caitlin Fisher</h1><br><br><center><img id="49666C7A-4FE0-4F36-B7D0-B09EB6E5E5C6" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/A7E0FB9D-C959-42C2-9186-8F02EED4AA69.jpeg"></center><center><br><br></center><br><center><img id="AD3E5112-2231-4A60-B5F0-54CE85FBD218" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/367D6529-A202-4C6D-986D-CA3FB51E017E.jpeg"></center><center><br><br></center><br><hr style="width:10%;"><br><h1 id="6E8E638C-79C8-45A7-9ECB-EC57C66FDF17">Christopher Gutteridge</h1><br><br>Chris Gutteridge’s interactions with OpenAI† for this book and the method he used.

Additionally, the use of commands like rm could lead to injuries if children accidentally try to use them in the real world, leading some schools to ban the game.</i><br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><br><br><h1 id="D1465E6F-C503-4BEF-B0DA-71D66501C2B0">Daveed Benjamin</h1><br><br><center><h2 id="4D0DBD59-3E8D-451B-8F47-7949E36F172E">Thoughts about Metadata&nbsp;</h2><br></center><br>I applaud the Editor’s Introduction. Below are some thoughts that I had while reading the sections&nbsp;<i>The Future of Us, The Future of Text</i> and <i>Improving not only VR Text or AI Text, but ALL Text. </i>I present these thoughts because they add to the conversation and are part of the design requirements for the Overweb, a decentralized meta-layer that augments online, virtual, and physical realities.â€¨<br>1) The creator cannot own, be responsible for, or control the metadata for their creation.&nbsp;We can’t rely on the creator having the knowledge, capacity, and interest to create or moderate metadata for their own work.&nbsp;Different&nbsp;metadata&nbsp;have&nbsp;different sources. Some can be automated, such as creator, title, and date. Others can be from the creator,&nbsp;such as the creator’s notes and tags.&nbsp;Some need to be the creation of the crowd and/or AI. The&nbsp;opposite of this is Today’s Web.â€¨<br>2) <b>Best practice abstracts metadata creation into a decentralized public space that any known persona can contribute to.</b> While we can embed metadata in documents, we can also abstract metadata into decentralized storage that bi-directionally links to the document.&nbsp;This enables large amounts of metadata, including multiple perspectives to&nbsp;connect to but not weigh down the original document. This model facilitates metadata creation by others than document creators. But this presupposes a&nbsp;unified metadata model across documents and&nbsp;applications. &nbsp;â€¨<br>3) <b>Metadata can overlay everything</b> (e.g., the Web, virtual worlds, the physical world) <b>and be triggered by anything that creates an event </b>(e.g., QR, text, imagery, 3D models, sounds).â€¨â€¨4) <b>Anyone can publish (subject to verification), curate, prioritize, and filter metadata. </b>And they should&nbsp;duly receive rewards for their contributions. We call&nbsp;this a fair value exchange.&nbsp;â€¨â€¨5) <b>Censorship-free environments need effective metadata filtering mechanisms. </b>People need the ability to create their own algorithms and thereby choose their own adventure. Personal algorithms should be tunable, transparent,&nbsp;adaptive, and portable. We call these smart filters.&nbsp;â€¨â€¨6) <b>People can be pseudo-anonymous. </b>They should benefit from their creations and activities and also be&nbsp;accountable for them. This suggests a unified one-account for life decentralized identity and security model. This is a non-trivial problem.&nbsp;â€¨â€¨7) <b>If Twitter is&nbsp;the digital town square a la Elon Musk, it needs a&nbsp;digital town library for the metadata. </b>The&nbsp;purpose of the digital town library would be to generate insight and knowledge that can support understanding and decision making, and cycle knowledge and information back into the town square. This would be both a Gruberian collective knowledge system and a boundary infrastructure for matters vital to the future of humanity. &nbsp;â€¨<br><br><h1 id="A903BF67-C14F-405F-8796-CC47F55CCBEF">Cynthia Haynes &amp; Jan Rune Holmevik</h1><br><br><center><h2 id="B629B274-7BFC-45FF-BC64-9FA54CFD3BA8">Teleprompting Élekcriture</h2><br></center><i><br></i>“Writing is a physical effort… One runs the race with the horse, that is to say, with the thinking in its production. It is not an expressed, mathematical thinking, it’s a trail of images. And after all, writing is only the scribe who comes after, and who has an interest in going as fast as possible.”<br>	Hélène Cixous<br><br>It is 1994. You see a command-line interface. A c&gt; prompt invites you to log in to this essay’s directory. It is now 2013. A prompt indicates your Google glasses are ready to receive input. What a difference 20 years makes? Not so much. The directory for this collection of essays is accessed through the <i>CyberText Yearbook Database</i>, but the thought contained therein is not unlike what will have been (in the Nietzschean mode of the future perfect) a scrolling text readable on devices like virtual reality headsets, the progenitor of today’s Google glasses. Such devices are not so much an innovation in reading as a <i>reading </i>of innovation. Similarly, this collection is not so much a curated set of texts (or the preservation of conservative reading protocols) as they are texts that insist on a proto-curation: typo(-il)logically proto<i>typical</i>. We could use a more simple framework and just announce a <i>redux </i>of <i>High Wired: On the Design, Use, and Theory of Educational MOOs </i>(1998). The prompts for reading this directory of our collective <i>redux </i>are <b>Movement </b>(Haynes and Holmevik), <b>Justice </b>(Vitanza), <b>Grammar </b>(Butts), <b>Web </b>(Kuhn), <b>Trauma </b>(Sirc), and <b>Reason </b>(Ulmer). Or, if you prefer, we can regress even further and sit in the wings of an Elizabethan theatre and serve as prompters (book-holders) cueing the actors in this six-act play. Perhaps it will be kinder on our readers to set up a virtual teleprompter that gets things moving.<br><br><i>Cynthia whispers: “Cue ‘Teleprompting Élekcriture’”<br><br></i>The teleprompter has become as ubiquitous in politics as it has in entertainment, creating an historical convergence of reading protocols that depend on machine and movement. Teleprompted discourse is especially critical for politicians who must simulate their oratory skills, and who need to appeal/appear as if they are simultaneously informal and improvising. Such ethos is emblematic of Plato’s concern that writing would merely equip us with the ‘semblance’ of truth; “Once a thing is put in writing, it rolls about all over the place” (<i>Phaedrus</i>). So, too, the 24-hour news cycle (by some accounts less journalism than entertainment) situates the teleprompter both in front of the individual who ‘reads’ to viewers from a vertical syntagmatic streaming text, then reversed toward viewers and placed along the bottom of the screen in a horizontal paradigmatic text scroll that anticipates the next ‘story’ or recaps previous stories.<br> <br><center><img id="21512056-F28D-4C30-AC87-7560733BAD5A" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/89F47802-DB40-488B-9FD8-8CA3C1AD9806.jpeg"></center><center><br>FOX News ticker<br></center><br>There is something primitive (intuitive) about the way words appear†. Conversely, there is something frightening (exhausting) about the way they dis/appear—scrolling upward with alarming speed, with the momentum of history, at the behest of time. In between, we inhabit the scroll bars, the space where movement and moment embrace. We witness language in action, in the languid flow of thought, the lurch of long-winded fragments, and the staccato bursts of out/landish play. We bid farewell to words with each keystroke, watching as they dwindle and fade from view. Imbuing them with invisible protection, we whisper, “may the force be with you.” We imagine them on their way—they travel as image.<br> <br><center><img id="65179539-FB36-4656-BFB3-2871208EF1F0" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/2D6B83C9-DB0B-4094-8AA6-56C60F1E1623.jpeg"></center><center><br>Star Wars: Episode 1, The Phantom Menace© opening text crawl<br></center><br>Who can forget the opening scene of Star Wars, the text marching into the infinite universe of the Galactic Republic. This filmic device tapped into our cultural experiences of moveable type, such as ticker-tape, cinema marquees, follow the bouncing ball sing-alongs, and vintage newsreel footage†. It joined forces with a simple premise—moving text transforms thought into image and image into memory. It is perhaps uncharacteristic to claim that moving words stay with us longer. But we are interested in the un-character that un-does static print—that imagines us caught in a thicket of the thickest thieves: language and motion.<br>	There is, however, a crucial caveat, or noise, in this system: the material action of writing sets language into motion, whether by programming or raw physicality. Composition happens, to riff on Geoffrey Sirc and Jacques Derrida. And, as it happens, language speaks us and re-members us at the same time (in the same moment). By some accounts, a focus on writing and motion must start by studying the parts of writing we see, such as letters, words, i.e. printed static texts. John Trimbur argues that “studying and teaching typography as the culturally salient means of producing writing can help locate composers in the labor process and thereby contribute to the larger post-process work of rematerializing literacy” (192). As “the turn-of-the-century Austrian architect and graphic designer Alfred Loos put it so concisely, ‘One cannot speak a capital letter’” (191; qtd in Helfand 50). But Trimbur is narrowly focused on the typographical conventions that “[enable] us to see writing in material terms as letter-forms, printed pages, posters, computer screens” (192), while we are adjusting the focus to capture the images of writing in motion and the momentum that accrues in the backwash of memory. Through the many years we worked in MOOs, we came to understand such synchronous virtual space as a primary location of writing as images in motion. In other words, the appearance and disappearance of language inside a screen, the limits of which were beyond our vision, turned the scrollbar into a memory pole where words unfurl in the prevailing and transient winds of writing’s warp-speed momentum. Typography became biography—the life-world of writing on the fly.<br>	Though the following exchange occurred in real time on October 9, 1999, it gives readers a sense of what we mean by ‘writing on the fly.’ William Gibson (author of the novel <i>Neuromancer</i>) logged in to Lingua MOO as part of a <i>trAce Writing Community </i>event in the U.K. We only had 30 minutes notice that he was logging in, so we hastily put out the word to Lingua users. He conversed with players in the MOO and created a ‘battered suitcase’ object into which you could place whatever MOO object you wanted. This is an excerpt of the MOO log that day:<br><br>Helen says, “Bill's here” snapdragon waves at Bill_Gibson. Jan waves at Bill_Gibson.<br>Bill_Gibson says, “Hello, this really is Wm. Gibson, tho you won't believe me…”<br>Cynthia [to Bill_Gibson]: “We're honored to have you here at Lingua MOO!”<br>Tzen nods.<br>traci says, “we're likely to believe just about anything” You laugh at traci.<br>Mark Cole says, “Hi Bill. Enjoyed the talk downstairs. Any advice for a budding writer of speculative fiction (don't u hate labels?)”<br>Bill_Gibson says, “Thanks. This is the very last gig on my lightning UK All Tommorrow's Parties tour.”<br>Helen says, “How would a beginner get that ball of elastic bands going? (Bill's metaphor for writing a novel)”<br>Helen says, “Anyone want me to buy them a signed book?” Tzen says, “Which book is it?”<br>Nolan . o O ( and pay for it? whooohooo. )<br>Bill_Gibson says, “Heinlein's advice: write, finish what you write, submit it, submit again when it's rejected.”<br>Jan smiles.<br>Helen says, <i>“All Tomorrow's Worlds.</i>You take <i>Neuromancer.”</i><br>Mark Cole says, “Thanks... have a jelly bean” You hand <i>Neuromancer</i> to Bill_Gibson.<br>Helen says, “Good advice Bill ;-)” Tzen says, “ah.”<br>Cynthia [to Bill_Gibson]: yes, would you virtually sign my virtual copy of your book? :)<br><br><center><img id="00CB5E0F-F66E-4960-8F26-365E87CEC9FA" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/ADA6807E-738B-42C5-B817-859153FC705B.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br><center>William Gibson interacting with Lingua MOO users (Oct 9, 1999)<br></center><br>The MOO, as locus and instrument of linguistic register and re-collection, circum/scribes this composite image of writing and memory. Bruce Gronbeck reminds us that Aristotle makes a clear distinction between memory and recollection and tallies the attributes of recollection in his treatise <i>De Memoria</i>, “Recalling is always a matter of reconstructing ‘movement’ or sequences of action” (140; McKeon 451b-453a). For Aristotle, memory stems from recollection as such: “For remembering [which is the <i>condicio sine qua non </i>of recollecting] is the existence, potentially, in the mind of a movement capable of stimulating it to the desired movement, and this, as has been said, in such a way that the person should be moved [prompted to recollection] from within himself, i.e. in consequence of movements wholly contained within himself” (McKeon 452a).<br>	Thus, early on our knowledge of how memory works is derived from Aristotle’s notion of motion contained. In her essay, “Habit as Memory Incarnate,” Marion Joan Francoz explains the containment model, the hydraulic model, and the physiological models of memory, advocating the latter and its association with habit. According to Francoz, “‘Image schemata,’ which Lakoff and Johnson propose as dynamic alternatives to abstract schematic representations in memory, find their most basic manifestation in the spatial aspect of the body, ‘from our experience of physical containment’ (Johnson, Body 21)” .<br>	But the movement we have in mind must also be a movement that is enduring, that gains momentum from the start, that keeps going. Viewed in this way, writing becomes a force, as Cixous writes, with which we contend and by which we leave our own trail of images. The trajectory of this essay follows three moments, or movements, along the trail of images we have left like bread crumbs for ‘the scribe that follows after’ and has somehow re-forged the relation between writing as image and learning via text in motion.<br><br><center><img id="DBDC5DE3-0F40-4125-8E40-86E7B9BD8C72" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/4217A8C7-6ECB-4F90-AE30-943B26A63C7D.jpeg"></center><center><br>MediaMOO MMTV Studio (May 9, 2011;17th anniversary of our meeting on May 9, 1994)<br></center><br>In 1994, when we first met in the text-based virtual community, MediaMOO, we quickly understood the power of writing in motion. The MOO is a blend of text and image, and of orality and literacy. Oral insofar as the interaction among writer/speakers in the MOO reproduces oral conversation via written text, literate insofar as the writing requires fluency to produce meaning. The interesting, and innovative, aspect of this phenomenon is that in the MOO tightening (and blurring) the orality/literacy split is achieved visually. Within months we created our own community using the LambdaMOO database, and within two years of creating Lingua MOO we had published our collection of essays, <i>High Wired </i>(University of Michigan Press), following which we created a graphical web-based interface called enCore Xpress, and soon thereafter, the 2nd edition of <i>High Wired</i>. Our task in the introduction to <i>High Wired </i>was, we believed, to articulate (insofar as we could) a new name for such writing. We coined the term <i>élekcriture</i>, borrowing from the Greek for the beaming sun (Elektra) and French feminism’s notion of writing (<i>l’ecriture feminine</i>), to describe a thematic conjunction between electricity and the streams of writing that spill forth in a discourse that resists traditional ways of organizing and controlling the flow of conversation.<br>	And even after we combined the textual and graphical registers of meaning- production with a graphical interface that split the text side and the graphical side, <i>élekcriture </i>still dominated the production of meaning. Rhetorically, the design allowed for style to enhance input and for an intertextual-graphical interface to border the space in which learning takes place, while the web-based interface also made many MOO functions easier to learn and execute. But the fact that graphical MOO interfaces such as enCore Xpress had helped move MOO technology along at a pace in concert with other web-based communication software in the late 90s is not central to the idea we are promoting of text as image; we considered it merely a bonus.<br> <br><center><img id="0FFF8C54-AE3A-4E33-BBB9-80A6CFA8B80B" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/0E91ECC4-C4A2-4035-A2DD-972441F3B548.jpeg"></center><center><br>LinguaMOO graphical interface, enCore Xpress (2005)<br></center><br>Nineteen years ago we got to know one another in language, in real-time. It was both a ‘home’ we could share and one we built for others to enter and build as they saw fit. We were living/writing <i>in </i>a <i>visible </i>text. The question of writing became a manifestation of personal and professional discourses, the crossing of which became for us an <i>invisible </i>boundary—we did not distinguish between the space of our belonging to one another and to our academic others. It is akin to Bruno Latour’s reminder that “in the eyes of our critics the ozone hole above our heads, the moral law in our hearts, the autonomous text, may each be of interest, but only separately. That a delicate shuttle should have woven together the heavens, industry, texts, souls and moral law -- this remains uncanny, unthinkable, unseemly” (5).<br>	The second moment is really a fast forward ten years when MOOs began to wane as the graduate students who created, administered, and populated them moved on to “real” lives and jobs, and we found other platforms where writing in motion served as our template for play and purpose: Neverwinter Nights, Diablo II, Second Life, and World of Warcraft.<br>	Yet, in citing our own experiences we are somewhat torn. On the one hand, we believe the durability of these texts in motion seals the sagacity of our argument (not to mention the reality of our lives, which is hardly virtual any longer, though we tend not to make that distinction). On the other hand, as rhetoricians we understand the need for a critical eye. Roland Barthes expressed it in this manner: “…my desire to write on Photography corresponded to a discomfort I had always suffered from: the uneasiness of being a subject torn between two languages, one expressive, the other critical; and at the heart of this critical language, between several discourses, those of sociology, of semiology, and of psychoanalysis…” (<i>Camera </i>8). This is how we approach writing about writing <i>in visible </i>texts; like Barthes, we are both “Operator” and “Spectator” (9). “The Photograph belongs to that class of laminated objects whose two leaves cannot be separated without destroying them both: the windowpane and the landscape, and why not: Good and Evil, desire and its object: dualities we can conceive but not perceive” (6).<br>	Barthes is instructive in an additional sense—as purveyor of the line between forms of visibility. In the static (print or web) iteration of this history, we understand that we cannot de/pict the motion of text we are de/scribing here. Even a “still” image (i.e., screenshot) of some MOO tran/script does not do justice to the movement experienced as graphé/flux (the flux of moving writing). But we can work with the concept of the photo/graph as theorized by Barthes because he re-animates it in order to ponder our pandemic belief in the invisibility of its animation of us. “Whatever it grants to vision and whatever its manner, a photograph is always invisible: it is not it that we see” (6). “In this glum desert, suddenly a specific photograph reaches me; it animates me, and I animate it. So that is how I must name the attraction which makes it exist: an animation. The photograph itself is in no way animated (I do not believe in ‘lifelike’ photographs), but it animates me: this is what creates every adventure” (20).<br>	There is, then, something that wants animating, that reveals itself when time and motion call certain features of text into the unconcealedness of typorganisms—of writing on the move. Barthes meets Martin Heidegger at this juncture, redefining the ‘origin of the work of art,’ following the workness until we can see it at work. What Heidegger saw in a pair of worn out peasant shoes, Barthes sees in the instruments of time and photography: “For me the noise of Time is not sad: I love bells, clocks, watches—and I recall that at first the photographic implements were related to techniques of cabinetmaking and the machinery of precision: cameras, in short, were clocks for seeing, and perhaps in me someone very old still hears in the photographic mechanism the living sound of the wood” (15). The third moment along the trail of images comes into view now. Are MOOs and World of Warcraft like clocks for seeing writing? What happens in the <i>seeing </i>of composition as it happens?<br>	It is time—time that moves into a new topos where momentum gathers itself unto itself, where (it turns out) moments are re-turned to time. Who are we to think we owned them in the first place? We are so bound up in our sense of sovereign subjectivity that we dare to preface topos with its own ‘u’—unbounded topos—utopia. But in so doing, we have managed to create every dystopia known to humanity. MOOs and WoW are, thankfully, no utopias; they are more along the lines of what Alok Nandi calls a fluxtopia. According to Nandi: “Virtu/RE/alities explore the gap between virtuals, ideals and realities. Fluxtopia can only be understood in the act of attempting to achieve the traject of any flow. But how do we achieve what we mean by it if we do not know what it is, except that IT is in constant mutation, flowing apart?” (np). Nandi exploits our collective delusion that we can capture the flow of media by setting up various fluxtopic passages designed to foreground both delusion and passage. MOOs and WoW are portals into this “fluxography”; or, as Geoff Sirc might call it, this “fluxus-inflected practice” (“Fluxjoke” 3). The key to understanding how momentum assists memory rests not on the rests, or pauses, we inject in writing and reading, rather in the <i>in/visible </i>border between delusion and passage, one that is (hopefully) not subject to Aristotelian or Platonic border patrols. In synchronous writing environments we are lulled, by the momentum of language, into no complacent region of learning, but an active accumulation of meaning we commonly think of as memory. The movement of language, its marching momentum, lulls us into thinking we are pushing things along, when it is more accurate to say we are being pulled into a remembering machine without being aware of it. The question is how does momentum and language do this. And here we issue a patch to our earlier thinking on this topic by adding a small “t” to <i>élekcriture</i>—<i>télekcriture</i>. To underscore how <i>télekcriture </i>accomplishes this lulling, we should sample the most basic qualities of flux: rhetoric, rhythm, and reciprocity.<br>	As a rhetorical machine, <i>télekcriture </i>mixes language, writers, and distance, then reconfigures them as sustained contextual real-time interactivity. But distance itself also figures within language. Barthes suggests, as have others over the years, that all language is rhetorical, that is, it is highly figurative. There are countless ways we attempt to maintain the distinction between two dimensions of language, the literal and figurative; but in the end, language is all figurative (<i>Semiotic </i>82-93). In short, Barthes argues, “the meta-rhetorical expressions which attest to this belief are countless.   Aristotle sees in<br>it a taste for alienation: one must ‘distance oneself from ordinary locutions   we feel in<br>this respect the same impressions as in the presence of strangers or foreigners: style is to be given a foreign air, for what comes from far away excites admiration’” (88). There is, then, in language itself a dimension of distance, a sense in which words travel across time and distance in order to ‘mean’ something in the here and now. Words exhibit the wear and tear of distance and time, and no amount of anti-rhetorical rhetoric can undermine this fact. But critics like Paul Virilio misdirect their fears at teletechnologies (like MOOs and WoW) in an effort to restore to language (and thus to ourselves) a degree of nearness and sovereignty that seems to have slipped away (when it was never ours to begin with). As Virilio argues, “[b]etween the subjective and objective it seems we have no room for the ‘trajective,’ that being of movement from here to there, from one to the other, without which we will never achieve a profound understanding of the various regimes of perception of the world that have succeeded each other throughout the ages” (24). In short, he laments the “loss of the traveller’s tale” (25), he longs for the “essence of the path, the journey” (23).<br>	Whereas Nandi’s fluxtopia situates the trajective within the work (i.e., the act) of writing, Virilio situates it in the achievement of writing—the having travelled along a path. This is precisely the tension at work in the difference between print and electronic texts, something we think Richard Lanham missed in <i>The Electronic Word</i>, but not something Michael Joyce missed. In attempting to articulate the pulse of Carolyn Guyer’s phrase “tensional momentum,” Joyce finds evidence of a missing rhythm—a rhythm not present, literally, in print texts. But he’s torn, too. “And yet I know, in the way someone watches water slip through sand, that words are being displaced by image in those places where we spend our time online; know as well that images, especially moving ones, have long had their own syntax of the preliminary and the inevitable” (314).<br>	Writing in visible texts, like sand and water, flows at a rhythmic (ragged or silken) pace. In the exchange of languaging beings typing along this tempo-trajectory, reciprocity arises. It is woven by the ‘delicate shuttle’ of an/other interaction—sustained contextual real-time reciprocal interactivity. Reciprocal interaction partakes of a fluidity of movement related to (and determined by) tides and time. The backward (re-) and forward (-pro) movement of the tides, the ebbing and flowing of Oceanus in Homer’s <i>Iliad</i>, lends its sense of fluid and cyclic language to real-time reciprocity. It is constant, continuing without intermission, steadily present, the constancy of real-time. Writing resists slowing down; it has its own force of forward movement. In digital environments such as MOOs and WoW, this momentum rushes ahead of us and we are merely the scribes following after, somewhat engulfed by/in visible texts and set in motion by our words—in their current—on their way.<br><br><br><h3 id="7688B907-7E7C-4A18-AAD6-F0AAB0A9150E">Works Cited</h3><i><br></i> <i><br></i>Barthes, Roland. <i>Camera Lucida</i>.

There are physical obstacles for people who must maneuver this world in ways that differ from the norm.&nbsp; A cry that has often been offered in these situations is that we are working within unique media that simply can not trans(fer)(form) for all situations.&nbsp; Don’t ask the painter to explain art to the blind? Don't ask a symphony to exalt to the deaf? Perhaps. The wilderness is a wild and dangerous place, where only the intrepid can (ad)venture. Yet there are mountain trails with ropes and braille signs designed to provide a taste of the wilderness to the blind or widened slopes to give access to quiet forests for wheelchair users.&nbsp; We need to take a few minutes to explore setting up best practices for access to VR. Let's discuss solutions!<br><br><li><b>Supporting all channels.&nbsp;</b>There are a myriad of physical capabilities needed to fully enjoy VR (mobility, sight, sound).&nbsp; How can we provide multiple channels within the VR environment to engage those people who can not participate in&nbsp;all of these channels (e.g., provide a canned experience for those with mobility issues,&nbsp;provide&nbsp;a caption for those with hearing issues, provide a running explanation for those with sight issues)?&nbsp;â€¨<b>Conveying the VR kernel.&nbsp;</b>We are using VR to communicate experiences and ideas in ways that could not be accomplished in other media. How then, can we convey the essence of this experience to those who can not physically participate in VR?</li><br><br>â€¨<b>Access within VR: Opening the Magic Doors to All<br></b>“Hey, there is a great new VR Piece you just have to check out!” your friend exclaims, But you don’t have the equipment, so you cannot access the piece, and the Way to Save the Universe and the Grandest Message of Them All just passes you by.  Or you actually have the equipment and you put it on. But the moment you do, you get so dizzy and so ill that you have to stop and lie down. Or you cannot hear the sound. Or the sound hurts you. Or you can not see the images. Or you cannot manipulate the controls. And again, the world passes you by—and you are left on the sidelines without ever getting the message.<br>	A protest that has often been offered in these situations is that we are working within unique media that simply cannot trans(fer)(form) for all situations.&nbsp; Don’t ask the painter to explain art to the blind? Don't ask a symphony to exalt to the deaf? Perhaps. The wilderness is a wild and dangerous place, where only the intrepid can (ad)venture. Yet there are mountain trails with ropes and braille signs designed to provide a taste of the wilderness to the blind or widened slopes to give access to quiet forests for wheelchair users.&nbsp; We need to take a few minutes to explore setting up best practices for access to XR. <br>	Another objection is that everyone is grappling with a different barrier, so how can we actually address everyone’s needs? The good news about accessibility design is that one measure often works for more than one handicap or purpose. Curb cuts, for example, are not only terrific for wheelchair users, but also for people with strollers, heavy dolly loads, etc.  So rather than seeing accessibility as an individual problem, address the needs of all users. <br>Accessibility should be a primary consideration in developing the XR software as well as the pieces created using that software. After all, our implicit goals are to help as many people as we can use our softwares and grok our messages. Simply being aware of the needs is the first step. At the beginning of a software or creative project, ask:<br><li><b>How can we support all users and developers within the software and hardware environment?</b>&nbsp;You need a myriad of physical capabilities to fully enjoy XR (mobility, sight, sound).&nbsp; How can we provide multiple channels within the XR environment to engage those people who cannot participate in&nbsp;all of these channels (e.g., provide a canned experience for those with mobility issues,&nbsp;provide&nbsp;a caption for those with hearing issues, provide a running explanation for those with sight issues)? </li><br><li><b>How can we create inclusive pieces to convey the messages using the software and hardware? </b>We are using XR to communicate experiences and ideas in ways that could not be accomplished in other media. How then, can we convey the essence of this experience to everyone, regardless of ability, age, race, gender, etc.?</li><br>Luckily, you do not have to answer these questions by yourself! There is an entire community dedicated to accessibility and inclusive design within XR.  There are best practices to minimize barriers and provide multiple channels to get the message, including:<br><li>Applying Universal Design principles to the technology</li><br><li>Creating more than one channel to convey the message (providing both audio and visual channels, text descriptions of actions, using both colors and shapes rather than color alone etc.)</li><br><li>Avoiding triggers (flashing lights, dizzying motions, etc.). If these can not be avoided, at least provide warnings</li><br><li>Following guidelines for accessibility, including the W3C working group (https://www.w3.org/TR/xaur/)</li><br><li>Working with  XR developers and researchers (<a href="https://xraccess.org/symposium/">https://xraccess.org/symposium/</a> and <a href="https://xraccess.org/research/)">https://xraccess.org/research/)</a></li>Examples of tips for writing pieces include:<br><li>Have adjustable volumes. Let the user determine the loudness.&nbsp;</li><br><li>Have warnings just like we do with flashing lights for seizures (this artwork/music contains high pitches)&nbsp;</li><br><li>Have captions (this helps hard of hearing, second language speakers, people on the spectrum, and others as well)</li><br><li>Try to provide multiple channels for the same information. Use visual patterns along with music or text descriptions.  </li>If you cannot reproduce the whole thing, carve out one piece that can be reached. For example, with VR, try to explain or introduce one small piece so people can get a feeling for it. <br>Use metadata consistently to describe pieces and their accessibility, including:<br><li>Warnings (pitch, flashing lights, inconsistent volume levels--standardized warnings would be great)</li><br><li>Content delivery (sound, imagery, structure, navigation--explain where the content is)</li><br><li>Content duplication effort (yes/no--does the piece try to convey the spirit or the same meaning in different ways? So having captions would be yes, but having just sound music would be no.)</li>This is of course, the tip of the iceberg. The key here is to open up these wonderful realms of possibility in XR to everyone and lower all barriers.  <br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><br><h1 id="135D228F-B7BE-4630-90DC-070C26C4F81D">Dene Grigar &amp; Richard Snyder</h1><br><br><center><h2 id="37DAD085-73DE-4654-A850-F745D247274B">Metadata for Access: VR and Beyond</h2><br></center><br>Interacting with virtual reality (VR) environments requires multiple sensory modalities associated with time, sight, sound, touch, haptic feedback, gesture, kinesthetic involvement, motion, proprioception, and interoception––yet metadata schemas used for repositories and databases do not offer controlled vocabularies that describe VR works to visitors. <br>	This essay outlines the controlled vocabularies devised for the Electronic Literature Organization’s museum/library The NEXT. Called ELMS (Extended eLectronic Metadata Schema), this framework makes it possible for physically disabled visitors and those with sensory sensitivities to know what kind of experience to expect from a VR work so that they can make informed decisions about how best to engage with it. In this way accessibility has been envisioned so that <i>all</i> visitors are <i>equally</i> enabled to act upon their interest in accessing works collected at The NEXT.<br><br><h3 id="6E664EFE-1E15-4A1F-AACA-E13DD92321EE">Introduction: Proof of Concept</h3><br><br>Turning their head slowly, the player spots five neon green pins in the horizon and aims their controller at the one peeking behind the conical dark-green cedar. The player is situated amid a strange, bright blue terrain undulating beneath a cloudy gray and blue sky. In the background they hear voices chattering and laughing softly. Moving their head further to the left, the player sees more green pins hovering over bleak squat buildings and an earth-like, blue globe. It seems like they are walking toward the globe, and as they get closer, they see a bookshelf sunk backwards into the ground. Approaching it, the chattering grows loud and then stops. <br>	This is one of the scenes in <i>Everyone at this party is dead / Cardamom of the Dead</i> by Caitlin Fisher†, one of the first VR literary works produced for the Oculus Rift. Published in 2014 in the Electronic Literature Organization’s <i>Electronic Literature Collection 3</i> (<i>ELC3</i>), it is now hosted at The NEXT. <br>	Like the 3000 other works of born-digital art, literature, and games that The NEXT holds, Fisher’s VR narrative is presented in its own exhibition space. A carousel of still shots from the work presents visitors with highlights from the work. The description of the work, cited from the <i>ELC3</i>, provides information about the storyline, the artist’s vision, and its production history. To the right is a sidebar containing the “Version Information”––metadata built on the MODS schema detailing bibliographic information expected from a scholarly database. This information includes the author’s name, date of publication, publisher, and language all associated with the 1.0 version of Fisher’s work. Visitors, however, also see additional information that goes beyond that provided by MODS: the work’s digital qualities, its genre, the sensory modalities evoked when experiencing the work, its accessibility, original media format, authoring platform, and peripheral dependencies. These are controlled vocabularies that move beyond the bibliographic and, instead, provide visitors with the information they need in order to experience the work. In this context, <i>Everyone at this party is dead / Cardamom of the Dead</i> alerts visitors that the work involves kinesthetic involvement, proprioception, sight, sound, graphical and spatial navigation, and that it was built with Unity and requires a VR headset.<br><br><h3 id="BC82D5BD-4002-4C06-B86B-4E6B6C986227">About The NEXT’s Extended Metadata Schema</h3><br>The metadata schema for The NEXT, ELMS or the “Extended eLectronic Metadata Schema,” is the framework developed to provide a common understanding of the highly complex, interactive, digital artifacts, like Fisher’s, held in its collections.<b><br></b>Because The NEXT collects and hosts a wide variety of interactive media pertaining to digital art and writing––the bulk of which it makes freely available for access and download in their original formats or in formats that have been preserved through migration and emulation––its schema both utilizes and extends the Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS) maintained by the Network Development and MARC Standards Office of the Library of Congress. By extending MODS, The NEXT attends to the media specificity of the works, an approach to the analysis of digital objects suggested by theorist N. Katherine Hayles in&nbsp;<i>Writing Machines </i><a href="http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=OYibzDRPNZwC">(Hayles, 2002)</a>&nbsp;and also reflected in taxonomies created by the global, scholarly federation, the Consortium on Electronic Literature (CELL), over a decade ago†.<br>	At the heart of ELMS is the contention that visitors accessing a work at The NEXT need to be made aware of its hardware, software, peripheral specifications, and other salient features so that it can be experienced fully. Taxonomies developed for extending MODS include Software Dependency(ies), Authoring Platform(s), Hardware Dependency(ies), Peripheral Dependency(ies), Computer Language(s), Digital Quality(ies), Sensory Modality(ies), and Genre(s). <br>	Equally important, disabled visitors need to know the physical requirements of a work in order to prepare for the experience via assistive technologies and/or other methods. Thus, ELMS’s metadata has been further extended to meet the needs of disabled visitors and those with sensory sensitivities so that they know the kind of experiences a work involves and can make informed decisions about engaging with it. Specifically, the system, aligned with crip theory and relaxed performance methodology†, pairs a controlled vocabulary that extends traditional metadata fields to include those related to disability access––what we refer to as sensory modalities––<i>with</i> descriptive language expressed in Plain/Simple English† that further details particular hazards disabled visitors need to know before encountering a work.<br>	Because the participatory, interactive, and experiential qualities of born-digital art, literature, and games involve what Vince Dziekan refers to as “virtuality” and a sense of “liveness” <a href="http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=DMc9UrW1gDIC">(Dziekan, 2012)</a>, principles underlying the development of the space and the treatment of the works it holds align well with practices associated with&nbsp;live performance. The concept of the performative nature of computers has been raised early on by scholars, such as Brenda Laurel and Janet Murray. Thus, in extending The NEXT’s metadata schema to address a multitude of disabilities and sensory sensitivities, ELMS’s approach to access draws upon the practice of relaxed performance visual story guides, similar to those created for relaxed theater/concert performances, etc.,&nbsp;when creating a statement for each work in The NEXT. These statements outline in Plain Language what a visitor can expect from their experience with a work and are tied directly to controlled vocabularies in the metadata that make it searchable and able to be filtered for a customized experience. <br>	A relaxed performance offers a comfortable, welcoming&nbsp;visitor experience that accommodates a wide range of&nbsp;needs. Disabled people and those with sensory sensitivities are able to participate and enjoy an event as valued patrons (“Sensory Relaxed Performances<i>”</i>)<i>. </i>A common practice for relaxed performances is the distribution of a guide that lets visitors know in advance what to expect at the performance and how it has been modified to accommodate specific needs. In context of The NEXT,&nbsp;the metadata located in the sidebar of an individual&nbsp;work’s exhibition space describes its unique, searchable&nbsp;features. The section called “experiencing the work” that follows the description of a work’s content provides the kind of detailed information, written in plain and clear language, that conveys to the visitor what to expect from the work and when specific actions occur.<br><br><h3 id="A4A2B693-B72B-4462-B51D-D9B244F7E137">Applying ELMS to VR Narratives</h3><b><br></b><br>Going back to Fisher’s VR narrative, visitors would be alerted to the fleeting text that appears briefly and then disappears. They need to know that text moves across the environment and that the reading time is also brief. If they have color-blindness associated with distinguishing greens and blues, tritanomaly for example, they may not be able to differentiate easily the color of the pins and of other objects such as the cedar tree, many of which carry important information for navigating the experience. They should be also aware that much of the poetic content is communicated over audio, and that the sound oscillates between soft and loud and, so, could be challenging to sensitive visitors. They would need to know that it is necessary to manage a controller and vibrations occur to signal that the visitor has successfully targeted a green pin. Head movements are also required. Some of the work’s meaning is communicated spatially via perception of artificial depth. Finally, visitors need to be alerted that they may be affected with internal sensations, such as nausea or dizziness, due to the VR experience.<br><br>ï¿¼ <center><img id="93E9FD75-2208-4228-9063-0688789469F4" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/2139540C-BAFA-49CE-9FE9-E6650B4D4CEC.jpeg"></center><br> <i>The NEXT’s Exhibition Space for Caitlin Fisher’s Everyone at this party is dead / Cardamom of the Dead with Controlled Vocabularies and Statement for Disabled Visitors and those with Sensory Sensitivities<br></i><br><h3 id="5CE5A3F0-D39F-4E86-9728-D45F903F65C8">Final Thoughts</h3><b><br></b><br>The ELMS metadata schema starts with the premise that all visitors to The NEXT need some type of accommodation to access the born-digital works held in its collections, whether it is information relating to the hardware a hypertext novel needs to function or the sensory modalities it evokes as it is experienced. Visitors who use screen readers, for example, should know in advance that they will need this technology to access a net art piece that requires sight; likewise, those who do not have access to an Oculus Rift headset will be informed when a work, like Fisher’s, requires one. In this way <i>all</i> visitors are <i>equally</i> enabled to act upon their interest in accessing works collected at The NEXT.<br><br><h3 id="62EAB7C3-3EAD-400B-9F49-9B85F04C20AF">Acknowledgements</h3><b><br></b><br>We would like to thank the organizers of Triangle SCI 2022 for providing our team of researchers the opportunity to work together in person during October 2022 on our project “Improving Metadata for Better Accessibility to Scholarly Archives for Disabled People,” which we have drawn upon for this article.

It starts in 1986, when he first conceived of a holographic poem to be flown to deep space (scheduled for liftoff in 2023), and continues into the twenty-first century through several works, including <i>Inner Telescope</i>, realized with the cooperation of French astronaut Thomas Pesquet aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in 2017. The author discusses his theoretical and practical involvement with space-related materials and processes. Special attention is given to his space artwork <i>Adsum</i>, conceived for the Moon.<br><br>Keywords: Space art, Inner Telescope, holopoetry, holopoem, Adsum, Moon, Sun<b><br><br></b><h3 id="A48DFB73-F4B5-474F-B432-8A74FCA4D6AE">Introduction</h3><b><br></b><br>I started my career in 1980, with a multimedia practice that integrated poetry, performance, and the visual arts. Beginning in 1982, I pivoted towards an engagement with technology as my creative medium, a sustained orientation that marks its fourth decade in 2022. Albeit lesser known than my other bodies of work, space art has been central to my interests since the early 1980s [1]. In what follows I will revisit some of the key moments in my space art trajectory.<br><b><br></b><h3 id="1DB65FD6-5534-4BB2-8607-AFDEB5FBF839">Agora: a holopoem for deep space</h3><b><br></b><br>In 1983 I introduced a new art form that I named <i>holographic poetry</i>, or <i>holopoetry</i> [2], which consisted in the use of unique properties of holography to create poems that floated in the air and changed their configurations according to the relative position of the observer. One of the fundamental tenets of holopoetry is what I called <i>antigravitropism</i>, i.e., the use of language in a way that does not follow the perceivable effect of gravity on writing. In other words, the creation of works that, albeit produced on Earth, were not limited by the action of gravity on matter because the holopoems were composed of light (i.e., photons, massless particles). This meant that, contrary to telluric objects, the letters and words in the holopoems were anti-gravitropic; they hovered freely outside, inside, or through the surface of the recording medium (i.e., holographic film or glass plate). Through the manipulation of this plasticity I created shape-shifting works; I produced a word-image continuum that, from the point of view of a moving observer, exists in a constant state of flux. I developed this art form until 1993, resulting in a body of work comprised of twenty-four pieces.<br>	In 1986 I created my first space artwork, a holopoem conceived for deep space (see Fig. 1). This work is in Portuguese and is entitled <i>Ágora</i> (agora, in English). In the work itself, we see the word Agora (now, in English). The difference between the two words, in Portuguese, is the acute accent, used to mark the vowel height. With this diacritic mark, the word makes reference to space; without, it makes reference to time. Taken together, they allude to the intertwined relationship between space and time.<br><br><center>ï¿¼ </center><center><img id="B2418FD9-4CF0-4D77-9AC3-14EBB8864DB0" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/CF048E4D-D5C3-4604-9D51-BB48A03D0A88.jpeg"></center><center><br>Fig. 1. Eduardo Kac, Ágora (1986), holopoem conceived for deep space (scheduled to be launched in the first quarter of 2023). The work is shown prior to trimming.<br></center><br>As seen in the holopoem, the letters of AGORA (all in uppercase, in order to create a weight equivalence between the letters) are written three-dimensionally. They converge to a single point, as if made out of irradiating light. <i>Ágora</i> was conceived to function like a message in a bottle travelling through the vacuum of space. It is a laser-transmission hologram, shot on 2mm glass with custom-made high-resolution emulsion, using a YAG (Yttrium Aluminum Garnet) pulsed laser at 532nm (green).<br>My vision for this work is that, throughout its trajectory in space, it will function as a ‘potential star’: in the future, should it ever be found, whenever laser light strikes it at approximately 45 degrees, it will diffract the incoming light and output a wavefront that will be visible to the naked eye as the word AGORA. As it tumbles amid the darkness of the cosmos, it will always encode the urgency of its message: ‘now’.<br><i>	Ágora</i> will be aboard the inaugural flight of the United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan Centaur rocket, scheduled to launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in the first quarter of 2023. More specifically, <i>Ágora</i> will be inside a Titanium 5 capsule, secured in the avionics compartment of the Centaur V upper stage. Once in orbit, by definition, it is the upper stage that provides the spacecraft with the necessary propulsion to reach its intended trajectory. Built specifically for the new Vulcan rocket, Centaur V will travel beyond NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, located at a distance of approximately one million miles (about 1.5 million kilometers) from the Earth, and into interplanetary deep space. As a result, protected by the Centaur V shell, <i>Ágora</i> will orbit the sun in perpetuity. <br><i>	Ágora</i> gives us a glimpse of infinity, a feeling of connectedness with that which cannot be known or measured, with the grand impermanence and immensity of it all. It reveals the value of the fleeting and the meaning of the imponderable, only to reaffirm the wonder of being here and now.<br><b><br></b><h3 id="88820977-CF31-4993-8F8D-AD85EE45A25A">Spacescapes</h3><b><br></b><br>In 1989, I transmitted from Chicago my artwork <i>Spacescapes</i> [3] via Slow-Scan Television (SSTV) simultaneously to Pittsburgh (to the DAX Group) and to Boston (to a local group of artists). The transmission took place in the context of the <i>Three-City Link</i> event, a three-node ephemeral network configured specifically for the event.<br>	SSTV was an early type of videophone that allowed the transmission/reception of sequential still video images over regular phone lines. On average, it took from eight to twelve seconds to transmit each image.<br>In <i>Spacescapes </i>(see Fig. 2), an alternating sequence of satellite views and microscopic images of digital circuits fused into one another at the receiver's end, forming an electronic palimpsest in which large and small merged.<br><br>ï¿¼<br><center> </center><center><img id="567CD20F-9533-4523-8D1F-7474F7F952FC" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/4BCD2A36-9F84-4C4A-9894-68AE8084460E.jpeg"></center><center><br>Fig. 2. Eduardo Kac, </center><i><center>Spacescapes</center></i><center>, 1989.<br></center><br>This work explores the analogy between patterns seen up close at a minute scale and forms revealed at great distances. <i>Spacescapes</i> creatively manipulates an intrinsic characteristic of the system, which was to scan, from top to bottom, the incoming image over the preceding one. As a result, their amalgamation took place at the receiver’s end, producing a continuous transformation of landscapes seen top-down—in which it was very difficult to discern what was the Earth seen from a satellite and what was a microchip seen through a microscope.<br>	Through this work I wanted to convey an aesthetic of magnitudes, alternating perspectives from the inward motion into a microscope to the vantage point above the surface of the Earth, and back again, continuously. The transitions between the two deliver a one-of-a-kind experience, interlaced as they are with the same electronic glow. Ultimately, the uninterrupted fusion of ultra-close and ultra-far images suggests the interconnectedness of the infinitesimal and the monumental, and the awe of our relative position in the world. <br><b><br></b><h3 id="892583FE-E9FC-4CA0-ABE2-A6E61C833076">Monogram</h3><b><br></b><br>My ink drawing <i>Monogram</i> [4], which evokes an orbital trajectory, a rising rocket, and a moon (and is also my emblematic signature), flew to Saturn on the Cassini spacecraft in 1997. Traditionally, a signature is a complement to an artwork, a graphic surplus often placed on the lower right corner of a picture or at the bottom of an object, to indicate authorship and authenticity. However, in the case of <i>Monogram</i>, I elevate the signature to the condition of artwork itself by drawing attention to its visual qualities and semantic resonances. The curlicues of <i>Monogram</i> configure stylized representations of visual elements unique to space exploration (see Fig. 3). Its iterability assures its legibility in the absence of the sender or a specific addressee.<br>	The original, wavy ink drawing was digitized and included in a DVD, which was placed between two pieces of aluminum to protect it from micrometeoroid impacts, and mounted to the side of the two-story-tall Cassini spacecraft beneath a pallet carrying cameras and other space instruments that were used to study the Saturnian system. A patch of thermal blanket material was installed over the disk package.<br>ï¿¼<br><center><img id="E693A989-EC40-41CF-992C-21DAFC8EF00D" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/6FA5B264-8A79-4965-8608-9AB0E0907A17.jpeg"></center><center><br>Fig. 3. Eduardo Kac, </center><i><center>Monogram</center></i><center> (1996).<br></center><br>The Titan IVB/Centaur rocket carried the Cassini spacecraft, as they launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's Launch Complex 40, on October 15, 1997. Cassini entered orbit around the giant planet in 2004 and completed 294 Saturn orbits. On September 15, 2017, Cassini deliberately dove into Saturn's atmosphere, burning up and disintegrating, in order to prevent the contamination of Saturnian moons targeted for research on the possibility of life. <br>	This means that the artwork, with each curve sweeping into another, was in deep space for twenty years, a meaningful fact in itself and also for its symbolism: the presence in the cosmos of a unique physical mark that stands for the individual maker, a personal glyph, a <i>manu propria</i> sign that points to the signer and voluntarily expresses it. A signature is indexical by definition, that is, it is a signifier that is physically connected to the signified, it unequivocally affirms the existence (in the present or the past) of the signee by contiguity. A “signature work” means an emblematic piece, one that epitomizes the aesthetic vision of the artist. The loops and curves of <i>Monogram </i>define, instead, a work-cum-signature, a consistent graphic pattern made of variable twirling traces that, overall, can be repeated.<br>	If today we already travel telerobotically between the planets of the Solar System (with the exception of Voyager, which has flown beyond the heliopause and has entered interstellar space), in the future crewed interplanetary spaceflight will become more common. In this new context, art will be a meaningful participant in the journey. In its singular, swift lines, <i>Monogram </i>seeks to express the vitality of cultural practice in interplanetary space.<br><b><br></b><h3 id="5AA8AB07-B031-4B3B-AA01-5B9C935AF7F5">The Lepus Constellation Suite</h3><b><br></b><br>Created, produced and transmitted in 2009 from Cape Canaveral, Florida to the Lepus Constellation, the suite is composed of five line drawings that were also rendered as five engraved and painted steel discs, measuring 20 inches in diameter each [5]. <br><i>The Lepus Constellation Suite</i> is part of a larger series entitled <i>Lagoglyphs</i>, ongoing since 2006, in which I develop a leporimorph or rabbitographic form of writing. The larger series includes prints, murals, sculptures, paintings, an algorithmic animation, and satellite works created specifically for visualization in Google Earth (more on the latter below). As visual language that alludes to meaning but resists interpretation, the <i>Lagoglyphs</i> series stands as the counterpoint to the barrage of discourses generated through, with, and around my <i>GFP Bunny</i> (a green-glowing transgenic bunny, called Alba, that I created in 2000, and that has been featured in exhibitions and publications worldwide).<br><center>ï¿¼ </center><center><img id="412D997C-8A80-42B4-BD0B-E662807C148A" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/F7E86CA3-8AB1-41E7-8794-543716B16F60.jpeg"></center><center><br>Fig. 4. Eduardo Kac, </center><i><center>The Lepus Constellation Suite</center></i><center> (2009).<br></center><br>The pictograms that make up the&nbsp;<i>Lagoglyphs</i>&nbsp;are visual symbols representing Alba rather than the sounds or phonemes of words. Devoid of characters and phonetic symbols, devoid of syllabic and logographic meaning, the&nbsp;<i>Lagoglyphs</i>&nbsp;function through a repertoire of gestures, textures, forms, juxtapositions, superpositions, opacities, transparencies, and ligatures. These coalesce into an idioglossic and polyvalent script structured through visual compositional units that multiply rather than circumscribe meanings.<br>	Composed of double-mark calligraphic units (one in green, the other in black), the&nbsp;<i>Lagoglyphs</i>&nbsp;evoke the birth of writing (as in cuneiform script, hieroglyphic orthography, or&nbsp;ideography). However, they deliberately oscillate between monoreferentiality (always Alba) and the patterns of a visual idiolect (my own). In so doing, the&nbsp;<i>Lagoglyphs</i>&nbsp;ultimately form a kind of pictorial idioglossia or cryptolanguage.<br>	In the specific case of <i>The Lepus Constellation Suite</i>, the five lagoglyphic messages were transmitted towards the Lepus Constellation (below Orion) on March 13, 2009, from Cape Canaveral, Florida (see Fig. 4). The transmission was carried out by Deep Space Communications Network, a private organization near the Kennedy Space Center. At a frequency of 6105 MHz, the transmission was accomplished through high-powered klystron amplifiers connected by a traveling wave-guide to a five-meter parabolic dish antenna. Based upon its stellar characteristics and distance from Earth, Gamma Leporis (a star in the Lepus constellation that is approximately 29 light-years from Earth) is considered a high-priority target for NASA's Terrestrial Planet Finder mission. <i>The Lepus Constellation Suite</i> will arrive in its vicinity in 2038.<br><b><br></b><h3 id="C1F0AB5E-C22A-4956-8C06-740AEC90F902">Lagoogleglyphs</h3><b><br></b><br>Another suite of works in the <i>Lagoglyphs </i>series is entitled <i>Lagoogleglyphs</i> (2009-ongoing) [6], space artworks that inscribe pixelated lagoglyphs (my abovementioned green rabbit glyphs) onto the environment and make them visible to the world through the perspective of satellites. These pixelated artworks are created at a global scale and can be experienced in person at their respective venues, directly via satellites, or through Google's geographic search engine (hence their name). In the latter case, the viewer may choose to see the work in one of the following three options: 1) the familiar Google Maps (in satellite view); 2) Google Earth (which can be accessed by typing “Google Earth” on a web browser); or 3) the equally free Google Earth Pro app (which has the additional feature of allowing the viewer to see a map over time by activating the Historical Imagery slider). <br>	In addition to the distributed artworks (seen in person; online; from space), I have created a video for each individual <i>Lagoogleglyph</i> by capturing, in Google Earth Pro, the view from space all the way down to the eye of the rabbit glyph on Earth (and back again to outer space). The videos loop, are silent, and average one minute in duration. Between 2009 and 2022, I have created five <i>Lagoogleglyphs</i> (and their respective videos) in the following locations: 1) Rio de Janeiro; 2) Mallorca; 3) London (see Fig. 5); 4) Strasbourg; and 5) Geneva. The videos #1 through #4 were exhibited together, for the first time, at the Venice Biennale, from April 20 to November 27, 2022.<br><i>	Lagoogleglyph 1</i> was implemented on the roof of the art center Oi Futuro, in Rio de Janeiro, in 2009, as part of my solo exhibition <i>Lagoglyphs, Biotopes and Transgenic Works</i>, curated by Christiane Paul, on view at Oi Futuro from January 25th to March 30th, 2010. Printed on a large, polygonal canvas measuring approximately 8 x 17 meters, it covered the entire roof of the building. For the inaugural work in the series, I custom-ordered a WorldView-2 satellite photograph, which was subsequently incorporated by Google into its search engine by pulling it from the DigitalGlobe catalogue. Even though the roof installation was ephemeral, the work still remains visible in Google Earth Pro. To see it, the reader is encouraged to drag the Google Earth Pro time slider to the date of January 2010. The time slider is accessible through a topbar icon that consists of a clock capped by an arrow pointing counterclockwise. The original <i>Lagoogleglyph 1 </i>canvas, together with documentation material, is in the permanent collection of the Museu de Arte do Rio-MAR, Rio de Janeiro. <br><br><center>ï¿¼ </center><center><img id="FDCFCBDB-C2F3-4BFF-AB7D-E4B83AB3873C" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/16BE081E-E577-4673-B9C9-33D20CD0223A.jpeg"></center><center><br>Fig. 5.

This time, the work measured approximately 10 x 12 m (32 x 34 ft) and was displayed on the roof of Es Baluard Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Palma de Mallorca, Spain, in 2015. The work was commissioned by the museum and is also in its permanent collection. Its image was captured by the WorldView-3 satellite.  <br><i>	Lagoogleglyph 3 </i>and<i> Lagoogleglyph 4 </i>were both made and exhibited in 2018; the former in London and the latter in Strasbourg. This time, instead of rooftops, both works were installed on the ground and were composed of grass and field marking paint. In addition to their distinct compositions, they also differ in scale and execution. <i>Lagoogleglyph 3 </i>measured 20 x 15 m (65.6 x 49.2 ft). It was painted directly on the grass at Finsbury Park, London, on the occasion of my solo exhibition <i>Poetry for Animals, Machines and Aliens: The Art of Eduardo Kac</i>, realized at Furtherfield, an art center located at Finsbury Park, from April 7th to May 28th 2018, and curated by Andrew Prescott and Bronac Ferran. <i>Lagoogleglyph 4 </i>measured approximately 8.5 x 4.2 m (28 x 14 ft). It was made of sod squares and installed in the garden of the art center <i>Apollonia – European Art Exchanges</i>, in Strasbourg. <br><i>	Lagoogleglyph 5 </i>was installed in the Cimetière de Plainpalais, generally known as Cimetière des Rois, in Geneva, in the context of the group exhibition <i>Open End 2</i>, from September 15 to January 31, 2022, organized by Vincent Du Bois. The Cimetière des Rois (Cemetery of Kings) is renowned for being the final resting place of notables such as Jorge Luis Borges and Jean Piaget, and for hosting group shows with artists such as Sophie Calle and Olafur Eliasson. <i>Lagoogleglyph 5</i> measures approximately 16 x 6 meters (52.5 x 20 ft), with pixels measuring 40x40cm (15.7 x 15.7 inches).<br><br><h3 id="01CFA56D-EA95-4F74-A337-B5A9DE2A618B">Inner Telescope</h3><br><b><br></b>After ten years of work as artist-in-residence at the Observatoire de l'Espace (Space Observatory), the cultural lab of the French Space Agency (CNES), in 2017 my artwork <i>Inner Telescope</i> was realized on the International Space Station (ISS) with the cooperation of French astronaut Thomas Pesquet (see Fig. 6). <i>Inner Telescope</i> was specifically conceived for zero gravity and was not brought from Earth: it was made in space by Pesquet following my instructions. The fact that <i>Inner Telescope</i> was made in space is symbolically significant because humans will spend ever more time outside the Earth and, thus, will originate a genuine new culture in space. Art will play an important role in this new cultural phase. As the first artwork specifically conceived for zero gravity to be literally made in space, <i>Inner Telescope</i> opens the way for a sustained art-making activity beyond our terrestrial dwelling.<br><i>	Inner Telescope</i> was made from materials already available in the space station. It consists of a form that has neither top nor bottom, neither front nor back. Viewed from a certain angle, it reveals the French word “MOI“ [meaning “me”, or "myself"]; from another point of view one sees a human figure with its umbilical cord cut. This “MOI“ stands for the collective self, evoking humanity, and the cut umbilical cord represents our liberation from gravitational limits. <i>Inner Telescope</i> is an instrument of observation and poetic reflection, which leads us to rethink our relationship with the world and our position in the Universe.<br>	In the course of developing the work, I created a protocol for its fabrication aboard the ISS, which I personally transmitted to Pesquet in 2016 during our work session at ESA’s European Astronaut Centre, a training facility in Cologne. In addition, I also created a separate protocol for the video documentation of the work aboard the ISS. From the raw footage produced by Pesquet I edited a 12-min video, which is an artwork in itself; in it we see <i>Inner Telescope</i> being made in the Columbus module, its perambulation through the station, away from the module and in the direction of the cupola, and finally its arrival at the cupola with the Earth in the background. I published this video in a limited edition of five copies. The video <i>Télescope intérieur</i> (<i>Inner Telescope</i>) is in the permanent collection of Les Abattoirs, Museum - Frac Occitanie Toulouse, a public institution that houses both a French museum and the Regional Fund for Contemporary Art. I have made additional artworks in the <i>Inner Telescope series</i>, including drawings, photographs, prints, embroideries, installations, and artist’s books. <br>ï¿¼<br><center><img id="986703BE-9C44-4CEF-BBAB-79147C12385B" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/0A4B731C-AB25-4581-A0DD-59B4F0C5A308.jpeg"></center><center><br>Fig. 6.

Since its release, the documentary has been continuously screened internationally at museums, theaters and other places, including notable venues such as the Louvre Museum, Paris. The film was published as a DVD in 2017 [7]. In addition, the bilingual book <i>Eduardo Kac: Télescope intérieur / Inner Telescope</i> was edited by Gérard Azoulay and published by the Observatoire de L'Espace/CNES, Paris, in 2021.[8]<br>	My <i>Space Poetry</i> manifesto was published in 2007 [9], when I started to work on <i>Inner Telescope</i>. In 2017, I finally realized the dream of challenging the limits of gravity I had pursued for more than thirty years: the creation, production, and experience of a work directly in outer space. The astronaut's mission was entitled "Proxima" and was coordinated by the European Space Agency (ESA). <i>Inner Telescope</i> was coordinated by L'Observatoire de l'Espace, the cultural lab of the French Space Agency.<br><b><br></b><h3 id="22FC5160-5D0A-4033-B980-F53E96561D41">Adsum, an artwork for the Moon</h3><br><b><br></b>Conceived for the Moon, <i>Adsum</i> is a cubic glass sculpture inside of which four symbols are laser engraved (see Fig. 7). The cube measures 1x1x1cm (0.4x0.4x0.4”). The symbols are positioned one in front of the other, thus forming a spatial poem inside the solid glass cube that can be read in any direction [10]. ‘Adsum’ means ‘Here I am’ in Latin, as used to indicate that the speaker is present (equivalent to the exclamation ‘here!’ in a roll call).<br>	To create this space poem, I developed a new typeface in which the letter “N” takes the form of an hourglass and the letter “S” has the shape of the infinity symbol. This makes the work legible from any point of view within the cube. The two other letters, which stand between “N” and “S,” are a lowercase “o” and an uppercase “O” (evoking the Moon and the Earth, respectively). Taken together, it is always possible to read either “NoOS” or “SOoN” in three dimensions.<br>ï¿¼<br><center><img id="A871BB8C-AB3E-43FD-8C9B-0B1CFDCB022E" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/0420D6D7-1169-49FA-81FE-1D5120295572.jpeg"></center><center><br>Fig. 7.

The shift in scale from the lowercase 'o' to the uppercase 'O' suggests a zoom effect going from time as apprehended by human cognition to the temporal expanse of the universe (and vice-versa). [11]<br><i>	Adsum</i> flew on an Antares 230+ rocket from Wallops Flight Facility, Virginia, to the International Space Station on February 19, 2022. The artwork was aboard Cygnus NG-17 (Northrop Grumman-17), a cargo resupply mission of the Northrop Grumman Cygnus spacecraft to the ISS under the Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) contract with NASA [12]. <i>Adsum</i> was housed in the Columbus module of the ISS.<br><i>	Adsum</i>’s journey to the ISS in 2022, traversing anaerobic, radioactive coldness, was a test to confirm its readiness for space flight. Further, <i>Adsum (regex version</i>), composed of typographic characters, orbited the Moon in November 2002 in a flash drive aboard the Orion spacecraft [13]; <i>Adsum</i> will progressively approach the Moon in two additional steps, each with its own visual and material version: 1) <i>Adsum (planar version) </i>will arrive on the Moon aboard Intuitive Machines’ Nova-C lander, etched on a Galactic Legacy Labs’ nickel nanofiche disk; 2) Finally, <i>Adsum (lander version),</i> identical to the cubic glass sculpture that flew to the ISS, will be aboard an Astrobotic lander that will arrive on the Moon NET 2024. As a result, both the planar and the sculptural versions of <i>Adsum</i> will literally be on the Moon, there staying for endless time, protected from the harsh lunar environment inside their respective landers, awaiting discovery by future space explorers—possibly inhabitants of the first lunar settlements. <br>	In order to communicate the work’s message on Earth, I have created a series of pieces that can be exhibited together or separately, including a limited edition of the laser-engraved glass cube itself, dozens of ink drawings, and a looping video in which we see the minute cube up close, continuously turning to reveal its multiple meanings, with the myriad reflections and refractions of the symbols adding a unique aesthetic quality to the experience. <i>Adsum</i> embodies and expresses the fugacity of the human condition and our awe before the cosmos.<br><b><br></b><h3 id="610824CA-1AA6-4CED-81AE-A6EAAF829088">Conclusion</h3><b><br></b><br>As demonstrated in the preceding pages, since the 1980s I have been theorizing and producing art and poetry that challenge the limits of gravity. It is my conviction that space art can be pursued in many different ways, all equally valid in their respective approaches. However, in light of the fact that what enables space exploration is its underpinning material reality, it is clear that art that directly engages with the technologies of space possesses a particularly distinct characteristic. Not in the sense of style or form, but in the sense of its contiguity with human presence and agency outside of our home planet. Making art on Earth through the use of space media (such as satellites), making art directly in space (in Earth’s orbit or beyond), or making art on Earth specifically to be flown to space — all are modes of creation and production that correspondingly have the symbolic and factual meaning of pointing to a future in which art and space exploration are intrinsically, and routinely, intertwined. Ultimately, art that directly engages with the technologies of space has the potential to contribute to the creation and development of what we may call “space native” culture—one created in space and for space. <br><b><br></b><h3 id="841582FA-6DE8-405E-9CAB-C393CBF9F383">References</h3><b><br></b><br>[1] In 1985 and 1986, respectively, I published two texts on space art.

It assumes a medium can be transcluded in another. It assumes that because VR or AR or here XR for short has been named “The Ultimate Display” in 1965 Ivan Sutherland, it could somehow capture all past displays, and their formats, meaningfully.<br>	Even though XR eventually could, we are not actually watching movies today that are sequentially showing pages of books. Rather we are getting a totally new experience that is shaped by the medium.<br>	So yes, today, we can take a PDF and display it in XR, showing page after page as just images at first and try to somehow reproduce the experience of reading in a headset. It could open up a lot of new usages because, unlike with a television or screen we can actually interact back. We can write back on the content being displayed. Yet, what is the very reason for a PDF to exist? A PDF or Portable Document Format exists to be the same on all devices. It is a format used not be interacted with but rather be displayed untouched, verbatim. It has been somehow modified recently to allow the bare minimum of interaction, i.e signature, while remaining integrity for the rest of the document. This has tremendous value but begs the question, why would one want this in a spacial world? What is the value of a document keeping its shape, namely A4 or Letter pages, while the entire world around it can be freely reshaped? What is the value of a static document once interactive notebooks allowing one to not just "consume" a document but rather play with it, challenge it, share it back modified?<br>	PDF does provide value but the value itself comes from a mindset of staticity, of permanence, of being closed.<br>The reality of most of our daily life, our workflow, is not that static. A document might be read printed in A4 or Letter yes but it might just as well be read on a 6.1" portrait display to an A4-ish eink device to a 32" 4K landscape monitor. Should the document itself remain the same or rather should its content adapt to where and how one wants to consume and eventually push back on it?<br>I would argue that any content that is not inviting annotation or even better the actual attempt at existing in its target context is stale. Beyond that it is not promoting hermeneutics or our own ability to make sense of it. Rather, it presents itself as the "truth" of the matter, and it maybe very well be, but unless it can be challenged to be proven as such, it is a very poor object of study.<br>	Consequently a PDF, like a 4.25x6.87 inch paperback is a but a relic of an outdated past. It is an outdated symbol of knowledge rather than a current vector of learning.<br>	The very same content could using HTML provide the very same capabilities and more. An HTML page can be read on any device with a browser but also much beyond. An HTML page with the right CSS, or cascading stylesheets, can be printed, either actually printed to paper or virtually to a document, including a PDF or an ePub, and thus become something static again. With the right stylesheets that document could look exactly like the author wants on whatever devices they believe it would be best consumed yet without preventing the reader from consuming it the way they want, because they have a device nobody else has.<br>	So even though HTML and PDF can both be brought within XR, one begs for skeumorphism. The PDF is again, by what it claims to be its intrinsic value, trapped in a frame. Bringing that frame in XR works of course but limits one can interact with it. Consequently focusing on bringing PDF to XR means limiting the ability to work with text. HTML, especially when written properly, namely with tags that represent semantics rather than how to view the content, insure that this is properly delegated to stylesheets is not trapped in skeumorphism. The content from an HTML document, in addition to being natively parseable by browsers that are already running on XR devices, can then be shapped to the usage. It can also be dynamic, from the most basic forms to image maps to 3D models that can in turn be manipulated in XR to, last but not least, computational notebooks. While PDF are static in both shape and execution model, namely none, an HTML document can also embed script tags that can modify its behavior. That behavior allows the intertwining of story and interaction. The content then is not just a passive description delegating, poorly as argued before due to the minimum ability to modify it while reading it, the interpretation to the reader but practically makes the exploration of complex system impossible. An HTML document in contrast can present the content so that the system itself being studied can be embedded and thus run, not through the mind of the reader, but actually run. The simulation become the content letting the reader become an explorer of that content and thus able to try to understand much richer and complex systems while confronting their understanding to the truth of that system.<br>Unfortunately even though there exists today a solution for true responsiveness of 2D content, namely stylesheets, this is not true of 3D content, even less spacial content that could be manipulated in VR or AR or both. True responsiveness remains challenging because interactions are radically different and the space in which one has such interactions are also radically different. A 6.1" portrait display, an A4-ish eink device or a 32" 4K landscape monitor are still in the end flat surfaces one can point at, scroll within, etc. Reconsidering this and more in both a physical room and a virtual one, eventually with some understanding (e.g flat surface detection for floor and walls), leads to a richness of interactions vastly different. Consequently one must not just consider how to reflow a 2D document from a rectangle to another rectangle but rather to a partly filled volume. Currently there is no automated way to day so beside display skeumorphically the document in the volume. This works but is not particularly interesting, the same way that one does not watch a movie showing pages of a book, even a good book. Instead, being serious about picking a document format, being PDF, HTML, ePub or another, means being serious about the interactions with that document and the novel interactions truly novel interfaces, like VR and AR, do bring.<br>	Assuming one still does want to bring 2D documents to a volume, the traditional question of provenance remains. As we bring a document in, how does the system know what the document is, its format in order to be displayed correctly but also its origin and other metadata? The Web did solve most of that problem through URIs and more commonly URLs, or DOI being looked up to become URLs pointing to a document, either a live one or the archive of one. The Web already provides a solution to how the content itself can move, e.g redirection, and browsers are able to follow such redirection to provide a pragmatic approach to a digital World that changes over time.<br>	The question then often becomes, if formats already exist, if provenance can be solved, is there not a risk to point only to live documents that can become unaccessible? That is true but unfortunately death is a part of life. Archiving content is a perpetual challenge but it should not come at the cost of the present. For that still though mechanisms are already in place, namely local caching and mirroring. Local caching means that once a document is successfully accessed the reading system can fetch a complete or partial copy then rely on it in the future if the original document is not available. PWA or Progressive Web Applications feature such a mechanism where the browser acts as a reader of documents but also a database of visited pages, proxying connections and providing a fallback so that even while offline, content that is already on the device remains accessible. Finally mirroring, centralised or not, insure that documents do remain accessible if the original source is not available for whatever reason. The fact that most websites do not provide either PWA or downloadable archives for efficient mirroring is in no way a testimony that the Web does not have the capacity for resilience, only that good practices for providing documents over time are not yet seen as valuable enough. Luckily efforts like the Internet Archive do mirror content even while the original owner has made no effort to make their content more resilient. Finally technical solutions like IPFS, or the InterPlanetary File System, make replication across machines more convenient and thus more reliable, again despite more authors not putting the necessary care into having their work remaining available beside providing them to a third party that will archive without necessarily facilitating access.<br>	Finally, being PDF, HTML, ePub or another format, the focus hitherto has been on bringing text, thus 2D, even arguably 1D if seen as a single string, to a volume, thus a 3D space with, i.e AR, or without, i.e VR, context. Even though this provides a powerful way to explore a new interface, XR, we must remain aware that this is still a form of transclusion. We are trying to force old media in a new one and thus will remain a limited endeavor. Yes it would surely be interesting to bring the entirety of Humanity's knowledge to XR but is it genuinely a worthwhile pursuit? Past media still exist alongside XR and thus allow use, either while using XR (e.g using a phone or desktop screen while using AR or a collaborative experience with one person in VR and another video calling from a museum) or before and after it (e.g using a desktop to prepare a VR space then share it after) ... or even through our memory of it. Consequently even without any effort of bringing the content in XR, it does remain accessible somehow. The question rather could become, what native to 3D format could better help to create novel usages, based or not on older format. For this there are already countless solutions as 3D software long predates XR. That said 2 recent formats did emerge, i.e glTF or USD, Graphics Language Transmission Format and Universal Scene Description. Both are roughly equivalent but glTF, beside relying on the most popular Web format for data, namely JSON, already provides community extensions. This I believe is the most interesting aspect. glTF does not try to be encompassing but rather provide the minimum feature set then one can build on it for their own usage. That means there is an escape valve allowing to be readable by all other software but if one does find it insufficient can build on it and adapt it to their needs. This means glTF could become a format not just to exchange 3D models to display manipulable objects in XR but finally that such objects could address the points touched on before, namely text as a primitive, its provenance explicit.<br><h2 id="D84B5DE8-82B2-4DBE-A01B-911147FD352F"><br><hr style="width:10%;">The Case Against Books</h2><br><br><b> </b>{<a href="https://fabien.benetou.fr/Analysis/Analysis">Analysis</a>: https://fabien.benetou.fr/Analysis/Analysis}<br><b><br></b>Books are amazing. Books are compact affordable ways to help Humanity extract itself from a naive state of Nature.<br>	Yet... books are terrible. Books actually were amazing centuries ago. Books are symbols of knowledge in the sense that as we look at a book we imagine how it will helps us learn. Yet, the truth is far remote from it. Books can be terrible, with poorly written content or even arguably worst, beautifully written content is either factually wrong or deceiving.<br>	Books were once the state of the art of conveing knowledge. That time is long gone, if it actually ever existed. Books are terrible because they give the sense of learning. They give the impression that because one has read about a topic, they are now knowledgeable about it. And yes, imagining that if one knows absolutely nothing about a topic, even the most modest book can improve the state of knowledge of that reader. Yet, is it actual knowledge of the topic or rather the impression of it? The only way to validate or invalidate that claim is to test against reality. The only way to insure that one did learn from a book is to check that newly acquired knowledge against the object of the topic itself. That means the reader must not just read but rather test. This can be relatively inconvenient, for example of the topic of the book is the temperature of the Sun the the reader would need a complex apartus, e.g a spaceship, to go and measure. This instead of often delegated to exercises, end of chapters questions with answers from the author. The reader instead of reading what the author wrote then have to temporarily let go of the book and use their own memory of the content of the book then try to see how that knowledge can help solve the challenge. This can be assimilated to a simulation, the reader tries to simulate the topic and solve. This already shows a very different way to interact with a book then "just" reading. Yet, this leaves much to be desire in the sense that the answer provided is often succint. The reader verifies that their answer matches the one of the author. If it is correct they assume they know. A great exercise will provide ways for the reader to actually verify on their own, like a mathematical proof done 2 different ways, that the result they find is indeed correct. This though entirely redefine both the consumption and creation of a book. At that point a book is not anymore a thing to read but rather simultaneously a thing to read and a thing to exercise with.<br>	This is a delicate situation for everyone involved. Designing exercise that are genuinely bringing the person involved to a better understanding without the ability to correct on the way is not the same skill as writing. Also having the confidence in launching oneself in exercises is vastly more demanging that reading a sequence of words and assuming they are indeed interpreted in a way that the writer would find correct. That means a traditional book to read is fundamentally different from what is usualliy refered to as a textbook. Yet, the very fact that expensive textbooks are the basis of classes, the one place and moment in time dedicated to learning, is not random. Over time the consensus has been that a book itself is not sufficient, rather it is a text intertwined with checkpoints that can validate or at least invalidate the acquisition of that knowledge that is superior. Most textbooks though are not consumed outside of the classroom. This begs the question of why. How come, if a textbook is generally regarded as superior, it is limited to a classroom whereas anybody at anytime could use it?<br>	The hypothesis here is that both designing and actually learning from a textbook is more demanding than solely reading from a book. Consequently the classroom provide support in terms of direct help from the teacher and also motivation from a broader curriculum with social markers like a diploma. Yet, textbook in or outside a classroom themseves are also relics of the past. For decades now the computer provides a new way to both design and consume textbook. Namely that a textbook can now provide not just an intellectual environment to run exercises inside of but rather a computational environment.<br>	A modern text provides the text, the exercises but also the computational environment to complete exercises. This sounds like a minor technical improvement but it is a radical difference because that environment becomes reality to the reader. The reader now has a place, even though an imperfect one in the sense of being simplified, where they can test their knowledge. This is a fundamental difference because the reader is not bounded anymore but the challenging yet very limited space offered by exercises and their solution. Instead the reader can complete carefully crafted exercises but also everything in between. Exercises become ways to efficiently navigate through concepts the author believe as essential but nothing more. The environment provided is of incredible value to the reader.<br>	So yes, a book is an amazing device. It has tremendously helped us to progress due to compactness and now affordability. Today though a book is not sufficient anymore except for the pleasure of reading itself. As a device to improve knowledge the book is outdated. The book should instead become computational notebooks providing environments to explore, to learn from the reality of the topic.<br>	Finally, if that is truly the case, how come computational notebooks are not prevalent in every field? A simple answer would be that progress takes time and that author of books might not have the skills needed to design computational notebooks. If so, time will hopefully solve that issue. A more subtle challenge though might be that the challenge of accepting to be challenged through exercises is intelectually and emotionally challenging. It requires one to be humble to let reality, even in the form of a simulated one, to push back. It always feels easier to assume one know versus discovering that no, truly, one does not. This form of interactivity can be seen as a spectrum. From consuming passively a medium, being a book to a movie, to consuming it actively while annotating it individually or socially, a form of hermeneutics, to finally interacting with the medium itself. That spectrum of interactivity might not be solely correlated to the depth of knowledge acquire but also the decision fatigue one must go through in order to complete such challenges.<br>	If computational notebooks should replicate books as the new medium to acquire knowledge, we must remain aware of how both designing and consuming them is genuinely more demanding to everyone. Hard fun remains hard but the agency it brings to both is a truly beautiful prospect for a learning society.<br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><center><h2 id="688D5F6B-F662-432D-BF58-244ABB5FCC8E">Interfaces all the way down</h2><br></center><br>How prototyping and VR go hand in hand to explore the future of text<br><br>This presentation will explore through one online experience-as-toolkit why interfaces are so precious.<br><br>We are navigating our offline and online lives constantly through interfaces. Some are visible and explicit like the table of content of books or the API, or Application Programing Interfaces, of software libraries while others, like our worldview or virtual reality headsets remain implicit and transparent.<br><br>Designing and using interfaces is not trivial and arguably some of the most pressing challenge on how to interact with text in all its forms. The experience while showcase its own scaffolding in order to invite modifying itself.

One just has to be faced with a random of the countless problems we face daily and the brain does its thing, trying to solve it however it can. The process seems seemingly transparent, simple even because we just do it, constantly. Yet when one has to solve a complex problem, one that arguably does not "fit" in their head, thinking takes other forms than an invisible process going through a single head. Thinking extends itself through media, being through voices in a heated debate to paper on a poster in an academic conference to a research paper or in a computation notebook. <br>	As we look at the extensions of thoughts, being a printed article, a data visualization, an audio recording of a debate, etc we often look at it as a record. That is only partly correct in the sense that yes it is a trace of the thought on a medium but it is most than that for the author at least. Beyond just a record or a trace, it is a vestige of past live thoughts in the making. What it means is that the very action of putting thoughts down on a medium, whichever it may be, does help the thinker to think further. <br><br><a href="http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=CwCHIScqmZsC">Feynman reacted with unexpected sharpness: “I actually did the work on the paper,” he said.<br>“Well,” Weiner said, “the work was done in your head, but the record of it is still here.”<br>“No, it's not a record, not really. It's working. You have to work on paper and this is the paper, Okay?”</a><i><a href="http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=CwCHIScqmZsC"><br>James Gleick</a></i><br><br>We must stop limited an artefact to just conveying meaning. We must stop limit the perception of an artefact as a way to solely convey meaning but rather always as an intellectual stepping stone as it lead to a genuinely new thought that was hitherto impossible until then. <br>	Writing, sketching, programming or waving hands in VR, does not actually matters. It is not the preferred medium per se that makes a difference in order to reach furthest thoughts. What does matter is actively doing something about the problem on a medium, so stigmergy with one self and optionally others. This specific act is extremely powerful creates the potential for us individually and collectively to move forward, wherever we might decide to go. <br><b><br>Author’s original note in email</b><br>I share this because I imagine most people checking the book cover of Drawing Thought <a href="http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=6bVYEAAAQBAJ">(Kantrowitz, 2022)</a> would imagine it's about illustration but, just like I was arguing the prototype itself doesn't matter, I believe the drawing itself here doesn't matter anymore after, only that it lead to a genuinely new thought that was hitherto impossible until then.<br>	Also I believe drawing, in the case of Kantrowitz, or writing, in the case of Feynman, or waving hands in VR for us and others, does not actually matters.<b> What does matter is doing something about the problem on a medium, so stigmergy with one self and optionally others.</b> This specific act is extremely powerful and as Frode you repeat to us, nearly ad nauseam when asking for articles we can then reference, creates the potential for us individually and collectively to move forward, wherever we might decide to go.<br><b><br>Editor’s note</b><br>Also consider Drawing a Hypothesis: Figures of Thought <a href="http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=9fINtwAACAAJ">(Gansterer, 2011)</a> and to a degree, Lines of thought: Drawing from Michelangelo to now <a href="http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=68nLjwEACAAJ">(Riley, Chapman, Seligman, 2016)</a>.<br><br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><center><h2 id="512D23F5-7B06-4367-8C7D-0A29B3CA8706">Utopiah/visual-meta-append-remote.js</h2><br></center><br>Not very helpful for publication in a PDF but at least demonstrate a bit how part of the poster (or another sliced document) can be manipulated in social VR.

I will make the comment with him in situ. Hi, Bob. I was just mentioning, Bob, that your editing of Andrea's article has been a real pain in the neck, but for interesting and good reasons, because you did it in Word or something and I had to put it in author, so I had to convert the headings, which is just drudgery. Not a problem. But the table of contents, it now takes up a huge section and many of them have maybe won. Many of the articles have maybe one heading. So this was really useful because I had to decide we're trying to put together a book of one stylistic presentation or are we truly experimenting? And of course, the answer is that we are truly trying to experiment. So it's really, really good that we have such different kinds of articles, not just in length but also in presentation. Barbara Tversky Article has had an equal amount of going back between her and me and a lot of pain and headaches, but also it's a very different result and it's very worthwhile. So I wanted to say thank you for that, both of you.<br><b>Mark Anderson: </b>Thank you for mentioning it. And I'm glad. As you know, I'm an advocate of of tables of contents that tell you what's in the book. Yeah. And the authors are the people, what the ideas are. Yes. So. Okay, great, terrific.<br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>That's very good. And any other things or business or observation? Oh, no. There is one more thing. Before Fabian from my side. If anyone else, please say I sent an email. Hopefully to all of you. It was a bit random, so if you didn't get it, I apologize. Saying Here are my observation of having used VR over the last year. VR, I took a few things and put it on our Twitter chat and realized this should be in the book and I invite all of you to do the same. If you've been using headsets, is there anything surprising, good or bad? And do you have any wishes? This is not a request for an article. It could be one sentence or a paragraph or whatever you like, but it would be nice to have it now so that over the next year as a prospectus will change. We have that to look back on. Purely optional. If you have it, please get it to me by Monday. Please, Andrea. <br><b>Andreea Ion Cojocaru: </b>I have something quick to say about my my part of the book. So first, thank you so much for doing all this work and. Can I help with editing that section? As in I've just skimmed through it. I've not actually read everything. I know it's a transcript. So I'm assuming in some parts is probably a bit jarring since talking is not the same as writing. Do you feel like the quality of that is too poor in some cases? Because if yes, I'll be happy to rewrite parts of it so that it doesn't sound like it's someone speaking so it becomes more. Or is that part of the experimental mark?<br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>My co-editor should feel free to interrupt, but because of your piece, the introduction of the book underneath the logo on one of the first pages, it says, This book is the result of the Future of Text symposium. It's the third book in the series. And then I say this book is an experiment and experience, just like all our work. So I think that answers your question. I really think we need to have fun with text. The future of text should not be one single thing. I think that a transcript that as long as you remove words like so, so so we all say so a million times. It turns out as long as that stuff is gone and as long as they're ‘Oh, sorry, I'm having connection ’, that bit is gone, you know, it's there in the video, we don't need it. But beyond that, to make it grammatically interesting, I personally see no need for it.<br><b>Mark Anderson: </b>I'd chip in as someone who has pored over the transcripts in the past that now I'd agree. And generally the presentations don't don't suffer from being in the moment. Sometimes there's a bit bit of sort of chiseling out of, you know, run on sentences or missed parts in in the discussion. But then that's a discussion. And actually the more you try and turn it into finely honed sort of written prose, I think it becomes subjective and it just actually you begin to wonder, well, why bother? I mean, I think the thing is to take it as it is. It's clearly stated, it's discussion, it's transcript. And I found very little need to do sort of editing in the transcripts other than where the the software is basically made a complete mis guess of what was being said.<br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>The interesting things on this topic is also in Jaron's keynote. I did the same kind of rough editing, mostly bolding because it takes less space than a heading, which of course is an interesting discussion in itself. But also I did a few bullet points, which of course wasn't spoken. One thing that he may or may not want to take out, and he has responded yet, obviously he's very busy. I asked him in the beginning of the presentation, he said he's going to talk about three things. He only talked about one in the end. So that will be an example where he could choose no and make it self contained, do more or whatever. But it is a really worthwhile and interesting discussion, isn't it? What is the transcript like? The transcript of this conversation today, Most of it will be useless. Some of it won't be. Some of it will be useful. And we over the last year we've been discussing this again and again and again, and we'll probably keep discussing it because maybe something interesting will fall out.<br><b>Andreea Ion Cojocaru: </b>I want to add, I found looking at that text, that transcript of my presentation in the two formats, so the one with the highlighted things and the one Bob did with the titles, extremely interesting even for me. I do think they're both useful, but it's a fundamentally different experience of the text. And yeah, I thought, I thought that was great. I've never I've never seen a text of mine done in two different ways. But this and this second version with the titles, I found myself actually reading the text two times in two ways, so you could read the whole thing, or you can just go and read the titles. And it actually became the place I go to when I have to remind myself what is the B and the flower thing? So I actually I had a talk two days ago and I was like, Oh, I need to put a B in the flower. Where where is where is a summary of what I'm saying all the time about the being a flower. And I actually went to what Bob did, I went to the yeah, I went to the transcript where Bob put the title and I was like, here are the two paragraphs about the bees and the flowers. So. So it already became a tool even for me, who gave the presentation about, you know, the, the snippets that, that I can refer to later. So I thought that was interesting.<br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>That is very interesting. And Dave Miller, who was both Mark and my colleagues, are advisor at Southampton, he said that he finds what he needs to cite not in a library or a reference manual, but in his own previous papers. So also Mark has talked a lot about writing for we don't know how it's going to be read. So this is an example of that and I think that what Bob did is clearly superior to bolding in terms of what you're talking about. I think the only place where Bolding wins out is to save space, but the breathing space that we need and of course in digital document, that's not a problem, which is of course the key thing that Bolding has bolding and italic has two different functions. Italic is to highlight in a sentence, bold to highlight on a page. So headings have yet another navigational benefits. And where I disagree with my esteemed colleague Mark has been just when he uses the horrible thing of unadorned text or plain text. You know, if you remove the spacing between the paragraphs, between the paragraphs and the headings, you have a different communication. I know you agree, Mark. I'm just saying.<br><b>Mark Anderson: </b>No, It's important though, because I think that's a misrepresentation. It's important to understand that what I'm talking about there isn't for human reading, it's for machine reading. We've got enough problem with not being able to understand our reading without making it harder. By putting in structure it has to struggle to remove. That's the point I'm making. Yeah.<br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>Exactly.<br><b>Bob Horn: </b>Yes. As long as there are changes to be made in the book, I would like to request that. And it may be very difficult because I know you're doing it with some sort of gene function. But the key subheads in my book, in my in my article, rather. The last time I read it. I don't know what's today, but, you know, three weeks or four weeks ago when I read it. The key headings had been that our. Centered. Have been reduced. The bolding has been removed. And the typeface. Is less than the bolding of the the subheads in the paragraph so that the major the major structure of the article is hard to find. I found it hard myself to find it. And then I discovered that that somehow all of these centered subheadings were light and and and our defined. Which was not my intent, which is not what I sent to you. I sent them as bold and larger.<br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>Yeah, but the thing is, Bob, I ‘don't care’ about your bold and larger or about coloring in the sense that for this work we assign headings level 1 to 6. So all the headings at that level will look the same. So the names of the contributors is level one. The name of your article is level two, and then what you guys have assigned is level three, sometimes level four. So for the really small ones, we sometimes build them, but in general we keep it to the same level, which is easier to see on the table of contents rather than inside. But I'd be happy to talk to you in another session about which particular things you want to draw more attention to. And we can I'm sure we can find ways of doing that.<br><b>Bob Horn: </b>Okay.

I spent a bit of time there for the history of pedagogy, basically researching a bit on the topic. <br><br><center><img id="3D155811-9222-429D-BB18-C00AD6ECDF8D" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/C8BE6624-5D10-4983-9487-90D0A1D1D023.jpeg"></center><center><br><br></center>That's the new one. That's the Bibliotheque Nationale de France, Francois Mitterrand. All those. There are four towers like this filled with books. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Everything under all the staircases are actually the reserve with all the books that go up and down with little elevators. And that's the map of it. <br><br><center><img id="5370B02A-711A-45DD-BA73-E89932A279C0" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/0EE6D683-C5FE-46BD-B111-F6FDEF893FDF.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br>We're going down stairs, and each of the tower has a specific topic, numbers, law, time, literature, and then a bit more. So that those three things, or what most people expect as a library, and it still is. But I'm going to argue at first that <b>we are all librarians.</b> It was interesting to see also on our webcams, when we started to chat earlier that all of us have a little bookshelf in the background.<br>And I think, of course, we're not well,<b> most of us are not professional librarians, but we're still struggling with it, struggling with reading the books, organizing them and seeing what's missing on our shelves.</b> So even though we were not professional librarians, usually I'm still going to invite you there for that short presentation to imagine that you would be a librarian and I'm going to argue that you actually are. (I have a bunch of notes so I'm going to stop sharing just for a bit). I think, like most of you, I have paper notes, I have Post-it notes, I have E-ink in multiple forms, I have posters, some of them still on the back of my wall, some not. Some like folded like this in the tube. So basically, in addition to all those books I have behind me, there are the ones there for that presentation that I'll share afterwards, I'm swimming in books and notes, either the books or the books I might want to write or read. So that's again, let's say I would argue the work of non professional librarian and that's exciting, but creates a bit of stress and tension. <br>	So of course I thought, <b>what if I had a warehouse? </b>What if instead of this tiny room, I had a huge library? What if I could put all those books and notes in the biggest space I could find? And I do think it would solve quite a few problems, but I don't think would solve all of them. <br>	One of the solutions, of course, like the E-ink I was saying before, is<b> if you have anything online or at least digital, you have a much you have unlimited space,</b> basically. <br><br><center><img id="F9EEE58C-C974-40E6-AAB8-5362A6372DED" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/8E3D253C-61E0-41FF-951C-B46A39244394.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br>So that that feels like a potential solution. Have a bunch of nodes on the different books I've read and then links from one books to the next. It's, it's helpful. But at the same time, I some of you know, when I started to discuss with you that that I find liberating and frustrating, it's liberating because as I said, unlimited space and I can organize them like that. But also, as you can see on the left in 2D I can have the different links from one book to another, and I can also organize them in 2D like that. So those are not there are other nodes, not books, but I have another one where I can just move them in space, you know, to 2D space. <br><br><center><img id="D253B07A-50DE-4D9F-8B68-AB9051FBF9F5" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/FF9B7D1E-C9AA-498E-99E0-CDDE70339139.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br>So I think that that does open up quite a bit of possibility. But you can see the edge of my screen and that is pretty frustrating. So at some point one has to reconsider like, yes, what how can we organize that space? And I think, again, as a nonprofessional librarian, we can, of course, learn from this. <br><b>	One of the things I usually find quite exciting when I go to a library is not the book I looked for, but the book that I did not look for. </b>So if I take an example, I go on the shelf. I looked for this specific book and right next to it I find something similarly unrelated. Or this I never thought of. And I'm going to maybe enjoy it or find it even more useful than the original one, the one I looked for. And I would argue that this is due to how the library, the physical library is being organized and thus the classification system. <b>So you have lots of different classification systems</b> based on the type of library and the Dewey Classification systems, but there are countless other ones. My argument mostly is that those classification systems or basically how most of the library is being organized, but it's relatively static, so I started to draw it like, what would my virtual library look like if I could take the different books I've read or the notes about the book have read, and I could organize them what it would look like. <br><br><center><img id="93F3759A-812E-4853-B325-6903A755B452" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/0B94A472-A731-44F5-B909-AC23ED6C1505.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br>And that's that's become the tricky part, let's say, is that then that starts to be in space. If I go back to the physical library, I start to again need to organize it. And I have a limited virtual space, but I still need to be able to go back to it. So if I change it all the time, meaning if I to use the analogy in the title of the presentation, if I move the walls of my library constantly, then I might get lost every single time. <br><br><center><img id="0B405DB0-9F45-4FC8-87F0-007654B1E03C" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/4710124C-D079-4688-93A8-B5FDF405A40C.jpeg"></center><center><br><br></center><b>One of the solutions I found for this was to do it live </b>because I don't know in advance how I want to organize. I can keep different layouts. You can see on the bottom right a little squiggly line, which is the layout of the library or where I would organize my content here would look like. I sketched them with my could be on the on the remote on a device, could be in there with a controller with the hands, and then I'm going to just extrude it. So I do it on the floor. I scale it to whatever size I want and I'm going to bring it up so that I can start to have rules and I can put content on it. <br><br><center><img id="285004D4-C76D-4FF6-878F-05ACD89E3DE0" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/FF6F234B-0765-49D6-9AD8-C7AD31EAE3B9.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br>I tried also, like so to take the documents from a physical device, even the digital, and then put them just as a layout. So that that's the question then <b>is what layout should one basically express either in VR or otherwise?</b> <br>	 I don't have an answer to this. I don't know if anybody has an answer to it. Obviously, if you have one, I'd love to know. But it means my my suggestion or my argument for it. Is that<b> the environment itself,</b> <b>the tool you present to organize your content, should let the actual user, all of us as non professional or professional librarians organize that space live. </b><br>	The thing is, of course, if we do it one by one, either by the controller, we take the either the physical book or the 3D model of it and we move it from one place to another. I'm going to argue that that doesn't work unless you have like five or ten books or you're infinitely patient, which I'm not. So at some point, I think the beauty of physically grabbing an object either outside of VR or in VR has its limits. <br><br><center><img id="34C30D6C-3365-4A9C-AD35-FB08459F8A92" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/C9036EE7-2769-4870-B15B-F65FA46A5E26.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br><b>So</b> <b>one has to go with this which is programming. </b>It doesn't have to look like this. Programming can be with blocks or can be with other other mechanisms. Can also be a lot of it done for you. So for example, if you click on a button there, you basically using software behind the code. <br><br><center><img id="3F7A5871-1B55-470F-83C3-647A70489B55" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/E9482F29-B362-42F0-977E-A6A1643F6505.jpeg"></center><center><br><br></center><br>You're not programming but using the result of programming and a programming language. So I think my argument here with the proposal is that<b> keeping both the natural interaction of being able to grab an object, but also having the power of scalability through code</b>, in the end, I think if we think if we take also those little robots when they organize a warehouse from here to a certain brand, that's what they do. <br><br><center><img id="AB3BF75E-DA79-4787-AFE6-BB1720C5A4CA" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/307969DF-D802-4F8E-86F9-1763480283DE.jpeg"></center><center><br><br></center>In the end, it's like when you just don't have the resources or the patience, which is also a resource not to want to do everything by hand. You delegate the machine that can be physical like this. But again, I don't have the warehouse I mentioned initially. I don't have this kind of robots and I'm not I don't think I want that, actually. But through programming and interactions, I think that's what can be reached here specifically. <br>	[on the facing page, grey with orange arrow lines] That's a <b>3D software called Blender. </b>It's mostly used to, well, actually choose for everything at the moment, but it's used to basically design 3D models like the one I showed before like this. You can draw them and then execute, shoot them. You have a couple of functions and some of those functions I find politically interesting or powerful precisely because they are the basics for programming like an array. So you take a model of a book or of the library of the bookshelf, rather, that the book would be on, and then you can multiply it instead of having it once you have five times, ten times. And if you did it twice, instead of having a line, you have an array, you have your box or your rectangle off  again, either shelf or books. So that's for some of you familiar with architecture. That's also what parametric architecture is mostly about, meaning that you give parameters, you say, okay, I want a bookshelf of ten books or I want ten bookshelves of ten books. And those parameters you can play with. And I think finally, that's where it's the most interesting when you have the direct manipulation. So with your video controller or with your hands and you can play with those parameters, you can say, I want ten by ten, I want whatever. But instead of typing it with a keyboard like so you're just going to take your handle controller and let's say go up or down with a slider, or you're just going to do any kind of gesture in space and that's going to change the space around you and that's how you organize your documents. <br>	<b>And I have a little example for this if everything works well.</b> So that's a little exploratory environment I've shown the couple of times I'm going to try to show you in VR how I interact with it. But still already to to clarify, it looks like this. It could look like a proper library. Let's show the stereotype of a library. It could look like anything. The background is not the most important aspect. What what is, though, is one of the documents there on the left, which is actually what that presentation is about, which I can share after with the text on it, the instruction there and also the code that… <br><i>	(Discussion on the screen not updating for some).</i><br><br><center><img id="924A3C8E-A639-41DA-845F-C9E189C6BAE0" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/86325678-92E6-42DD-AA9E-52F41F7DD355.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br><b>So the environment itself is not that interesting. It's for the exploratory scaffolding. </b>That's my excuse. Let's say to. To say it looks rough. <br>	There are a couple of construction text you can move around, manipulate, and some of that text with the ‘JXR’ prefix is actually code you can execute, and if you have a keyboard like I'm showing on the webcam, Bluetooth keyboard, you can also type or modify some of that text or code. It's there that says the starting point. So let me try to show you again from the headset. <br><b>	</b>The grid you see there is when I get too close and then I see safely the environment. What's interesting compared to before. <br><center><br></center><center><img id="24094144-519C-4D54-8167-4D1000DE48DF" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/BD484C32-E9CA-495E-9DC1-EAE2DC65FD89.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br>	I can see my hands and I can grab the text, move it around, I can interact with my wrist to hide and show things. <b>The the novelty would be this that I can grab that text executed.</b> <br>	I move with my right hand, execute with my left hand. <br>	I can see this number here that gets updated every time I pinch. So it's a bit hard to read, but I can see it changing, let's say, from a small value when I pinch twice. So between, let's say, those two points and the large value if I pinch there. So you just see 0.9 or something, why do I show this is because what I can then do is use that code here. And that's what happens. So I the this document can be any document, of course. Fabian Yeah.<br>	So you see my hands? Yes. I can pinch there. And it's going to store this little value on the top left. If I pinch at one point that another, that value changed. To say the distance between those two points was this much and I can take a document. Like the notes about that presentation, Move it around. And what's interesting to highlight the point there is if I use this command here and pitch it’s going to take the last grab to document the value here and it's going to reproduce it N times. So here that would be, let's say 16 times. If I had another document, it would apply to that document. And if I type on my little keyboard here. So you can see the code there or I mean, some text appearing there. <br><b>	My point being that this idea of being able to take a document, a series of document or shelve so that you can organize that space both at a very large scale because it's programmatic and yet tangible. </b>Because I can I mean, tangible, directly manipulable is where it becomes interesting to manipulate documents and the way you organize, organize them in space. That intersection which you remove the headset to avoid framing the issue and more. Yes. So that's I believe it's the point where it gets interesting when you can have through programming or parametric architecture or design, the ability to manipulate a large corpus of documents and yet preserving that ability to manipulate directly. So you could imagine, of course, that, for example, through the beautiful drawing, I could instead of saying, Oh, I want to take ten books or 100 books, and I pinch twice that I would take an arrow with my hands and it would multiply the result. It's not visibly director, but you can imagine, say, selecting the documents, you see another color or the arrow visible, and then you see it spread over an area rather than just a line. And that was it.<br><br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>Before I say thank you. Actually, after I say thank you and thank you. I thought you hated books. Fabian, you have an article in the future of text saying I hate books. So it's just because it's this work you showed us today only referring to legacy books, or is this because you're envisioning books also being something different?<br><b>Fabien Benetou: </b>I think that you put it the right way. <b>Legacy books.</b> I think this is this is horrible. I love those books, but I think every book should have with them some code so that you can have some implementation of the idea with the books that you can play with and challenge the content of that book. I'm saying this, of course. Yeah, like you said, legacy. Funnily enough, I was reading an article last week about learning nano physics in VR, and the outcome of that research was that bringing legacy content. So here it was in VR, learning the new physics. So you're with your headset, you play with extremely dangerous and expensive machine, and what you have next to you actually is not the book, but it's a fake iPad or virtual iPad so that you would have a notebook within or actually instructions in a traditional way, let's say from the old medium to the new medium. So I don't want to throw my books actually cherish them. But but they are all all, no matter how good, terribly outdated, I think, as a pedagogical medium, if your point is to learn and challenge the content. Books are horrible.<br><br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>Okay. Well, we're waiting for other comments. I have to ask the question. We've discussed a lot and that is our future of text volume three, which will have one incarnation and a plain boring PDF. And <b>what manner, Fabian, do you currently this book going into VR?</b> Obviously, for the rest of you, the book is will be available as HTML or JSON. Obviously. PDF. So what should we do for IBM to really support your vision?<br><b>Fabien Benetou: </b>So I'm going to you can imagine a library as a corpus of books. You can imagine the book for the future of Texas as a corpus of chapters. So in the end, what I'm going to do is explore how to organize those subunits or chapters, let's say, in space and through this, like parametric design of the space with direct interaction in VR and programming. So that because how many chapters do we have right now? Right now, roughly. We're going to hear you're going to hear.<br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>Exactly too many.<br><b>Fabien Benetou: </b>Wow. So that's a perfect example of when it becomes, in my opinion, interesting to have both direct and scalable through programming. Way to organize the space. So 2 minutes the answer was hoping for.<br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>Yeah, it's a little over a quarter million words back. Well, the whole point of the book that it is too long, actually. Let me just check something here. One second. I'm so sorry. Right. I'm going to share my screen really quickly to address your question of the size of the book. <br>[shows a screen cast of navigating the PDF version of the book in Reader by doing right and left arrows for next and previous pages and down and up arrows for next and previous article as presented on <a href="https://youtu.be/6hnr0jwT4kM">https://youtu.be/6hnr0jwT4kM</a>]<br>So if we go, we have our not very nice cover page. And then here is the table contents. And you can see Andreas, we're talking about earlier. So a ton of subheadings and then some really short. I am also somebody who has a lot of subheadings, as do you, Fabian. We have level two because we've written several articles.<br><b>Mark Anderson: </b>Can I put my headings back in then?<br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>Yes, Mark. Of course you need to do that. And you've been one of the experimental subjects for this. But this is the thing that I wanted to show on the size matters issue. <br>	So I'm now going through I get to Andrea's article, which is absolutely massive because it's two things. It's her piece for the symposium, but also her two hour presentation, just like today with Fabian. So <b>if I go through it page by page, and especially with a layout that Bob introduced by having a lot of subheadings, it takes a lot of pages. </b>So when you are interested in this article, that's only good, right? But if you want to skip through it, what we've done is this in our reader software using visual matter. If you use right and left arrows, you go by pages. But if you do down arrow, you go to the next level one heading. So it's a super simple, not sophisticated thing. But the point is you can really quickly, like I skipped everything that Barbara's written here, and that's a lot of pages with one zero.<br><b>Jim Strahorn : </b>Right. Magnificent.<br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>Yeah. Thank you. I just wanted to say that in parallel to what Fabian was talking about, really amazing spaces, basic navigation interactions, they're actually really hard to think of, and sometimes they end up being actually quite simple. So I'm looking forward to the complexity that Fabian is introducing to see what kind of simple navigations will hopefully come out of them. I am so sure Andreea has got at least three different thoughts going on right now.<br><br><b>Andreea Ion Cojocaru: </b>Yes. How much time do I have to talk? I'm joking. So first question for Fabian. I want to make sure that I understand the proposition clearly so. Is what you showed us the ability for four people in VR to run certain methods pieces of code themselves. <b>Is that something that is an alternative to the typical way of doing software, which is you you, you embed that behind nice icons, that you push buttons?</b><br><b>Fabien Benetou: </b>Um, yes, you can see, actually, Adam had a related question in the chat is like, do you want to know code library and just interaction. The point, in my opinion, is not hiding the scaffolding. The scaffolding should remain visible so that people who want to and can can modify it so that it the code itself is not so interesting, but the ability to modify it right there and then and position it wherever it helps you to think better about it, I think is, yeah, it's unique, let's say. And is it better than traditional, let's say way? Not necessarily. Is it novel and hopefully leading to other way to explore how the content itself you manipulate? I believe it is.<br><br><b>Andreea Ion Cojocaru: </b>Yeah, I totally agree. I think. Yeah. There's just so much to say. I will. I will only make one more comment. I. You said a few times the background or the environment, as if that's something separate from what you're doing. So you have these objects and the text and the images and the pieces of code, which are the things you care about. And then there's the other thing in the back that someone is to make pretty I think that undermines. What VR is for me as an architect about which is space. So all of those steps and objects have to become architectural elements somehow. So what you interact with and manipulate are, are either objects in space that rearrange themselves in space or or spaces themselves. And we can talk for a long time about what does it mean to have just space without an object or a building to define it.<br><b>Fabien Benetou: </b>I know. So absolutely. The thing is, I'm just not far enough. But of course, of course, <b>the point is that the background should not be just the background. </b>The background should be the shelf of the library or the end or whatever you want that you modify by the code itself. There should be no background. The background here is just because I'm not as fresh as I want to be. So I have to be a little bit vulgar or provocative. But but there should be absolutely no background that there is. There is no reason for it. It's just I it takes a bit of time. But but in the end, if you the goal is that there is no background because you generate it through the intertwined interactions and code that how you manipulate the code, how you move so that the let's say variables or parameter in the code are always going to shape everything around you, including how you position that space. So background is is not correct you're right about this.<br><b>Andreea Ion Cojocaru: </b>I would add that if you were to prototype with this idea of spaces in mind, that will open up a different design space because your relationship as a user to big objects or to space is different than your relationship as a user to pieces of text. So the moment like the kind of operations and the kind of interactions that you could do with spaces and objects are actually different. So it will change. It would fundamentally change actually your decision making process and and the outcome of those decisions, when you change from text or to the images to actually manipulating or moving through space.<br><b>Fabien Benetou: </b>So to to clarify the the last comment, the last moment I changed the repository to show you something today was 3 minutes before the presentation. So I'm really not pushing it aside what you're saying. I'm just saying that, yes, this is what I want. I just didn't have the time to think it through and the time to implement it. But that's what I'm doing.<br><br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>This is such a huge and important issue. Briefly, going back to the earlier thing you talked about kind of text and the environment that can do something. Vint Cerf likes to use the term<b> ‘computational text’.</b> I would love to be able to write an an article something like I just put in chat here, something like, for example, like what everyone else in this book says who went to Southampton? And have that understood by the book. And then in brackets, say Mark Anderson says so and so. Right. It's a trivial example, but it's the idea that you shouldn't just have a do it later. As an author, you should have a little bit of control. And of course, as a reader, I should have a little control. So that's a hugely fascinating area. But when it comes to the point of background, first of all, there's a British comedy called Goodness Gracious Me, that has an amazing episode of background. We'll talk about that over lots of alcohol at the Groucho Club. However, sometimes you do want a neutral background. Over the last few days, doing better writing and author in VR, you know, there is it depends if you're doing research and looking fine. Yes. Ideally the whole space you immerse yourself, you literally go to the library, but sometimes you want to focus on a knowledge, object or creation. Otherwise you want a neutral background. So I'm not at all arguing against what you guys are saying. I'm just saying that maybe for different types of modes and work in time and feelings, you should have the choice whether to immerse yourself in the knowledge which can be heavy and fantastic, or sometimes a lighter touch or sometimes even a more neutral background, just so that your head can focus on the task at hand and not be distracted. Does that sound against what you're saying or does that kind of fit?<br><b>Fabien Benetou: </b>No, but to to jump on that is yes, also, of course, because you can as long as you have the control of that background, like if you want your background to be as neutral as you want, that's still the same point. Like you you shape it the way you want that that's the important aspect that you the it's optimising agency. <br>	How can you have it the way you want. <br>	That's, that's the goal behind it. <br>	So if the goal is to be neutral because you want let's say to start from a quote unquote blank page or blank space, if that's the psychological space you want to be in to do the task you have at hand, that should be the book. That should be how efficiently you can shape it. That's criteria for success.<br><br><b>Daveed Benjamin: </b>Thanks. Really interesting. Fabian, you're bringing up some things for me that I've been thinking about for a long time. <b>I'm very resonant with the notion that I should be able to really access my digital notes easily and be able to collate them and and put them in groups and put them in lists and really accelerate my ability to to make sense out of them.</b> And one of the things I wanted to mention around that is I've been really thinking of kind of a social book where it's even more than just my notes. It's everybody's notes. And I guess it's like the computational text that you just talked about. Where I can see what other people have also said in the book, and this could be a physical book using augmented reality or it could be a virtual reality book as well. The one other concept around that I think is super important, and it's the concept that I've been using in my Web based work as well, is the the notion of a bridge. So to be able to connect a passage in a book to another passage in another book and give it a relationship. So it could be a contradictory bridge from. Actually from an image in one book to a piece of text in another. And just imagining, especially if the relationships were verified and I was able to see all those connections that anyone else had put together, that it it actually becomes another way of thinking about a library. I mean, much better than the Dewey Decimal System in terms of finding things and and also really finding things like you're saying, the things that you didn't expect to find because you're actually you're reading a book and you're interested in a particular paragraph, and then you decide to drill down on it and it shows everything that anyone else thought was directly connected to that and any other book. PDF etc. So that that's interesting to me. And then back about four or five years ago, I, I had done a presentation about the future of books. And what I my premise was that the book in the future becomes a guided and curated pathway through the relevant universe of multimedia interactions and experiences that are really part of the narrative that the book wants to do. And the last thing I'll talk about is I've been really thinking about how we can re-imagine the web from something that's flat and static to a multi layered. And so the notion of a library layer on top of the web is really interesting to me, and especially if it allows us to to connect bridges between pieces of text on a web page to other pieces of text or images or segments of videos and segments of podcasts, you all of a sudden have a have kind of a. A way to to have that discovery that we were talking about earlier that you mentioned, where you're not necessarily looking for it, but wow, look at all the other things that are connected to this thing that I'm looking at. So I'm really thinking a lot about that library layer. I'm building the layer anyway, but it could certainly be a library layer. And I'm going to put an article that I wrote about to Twitter and how the digital town square actually needs a digital town library. So anyway, I'm really, really intrigued by your work. Thank you.<br><b>Fabien Benetou: </b>Thank you. I'm going to put also a link on the on the chat. First, everything I've done is on the web, including the wiki. So my website with all the notes is publicly available. <br>	Not all my notes. <br>	Like for example, sometimes I write my dreams when I wake up in the morning. So that's not public, but pretty much everything else is. And that includes a bunch of links not just within it, but to a bunch of other platforms. And and what I put also in the chat is an issue in the repository on the federated aspect, because I'll be honest, I'm excited if some of you wants to play with this, if some of you want to contribute to the code or write some modifiers on how to organize space, But I don't want to host it for you, not because I don't care, but because I think if it's your work, your data, you should properly own it. But it doesn't mean I want you to do it in your corner. In each of us it our corner. So for the bridging and social aspect beyond, let's say just content, I find a federation aspect. So like we see at the moment with Mastodon or YouTube where there are quite a few solution using an activity pub on how you do an action and you can broadcast it to your network, your network of friends or everybody who is interested. I started to work on this recently. It does work up to some aspect, but then the question becomes, let's say, what do you actually share? So right now you can share code snippets so that I don't know, let's imagine that Andrea starts to tinker with a modifier on how to shape something that is not the background anymore because it's interesting enough to be useful and to put the code next to books or anything we can start to imagine, which is the interesting aspect. And then can I just literally grab it and put it on my shortcut, which is my virtual wristband in view, and then use it. So how can we exchange that part, which is the the code to manipulate the content, but also can we exchange viewpoints? So, for example, if at some point she wants to show me, oh, this is the part that is interesting because I apply that modifier and organize my bookshelf like this, do I get a screenshot out of it? Is it a2d screenshot? Like literally the perspective or is it a3d screenshot so that I can actually peek inside that space and just like part of that space, is it dynamic? Like is it literally her view alive or is it something recorded couple of days or months ago? So that that issue on on there is specifically trying to address that point because obviously most of the interesting thing I do, I get through discussions like this is that me and my corner, that's the social aspect of it. So yeah, that's when it becomes interesting.<br><br><h3 id="01651A92-24CF-4E82-A5B3-463398367465">Discussion</h3><br><br><b>Patrick Lichty: </b>I think this is really interesting work. Can I ask <b>what engine you're using?</b><br><b>Fabien Benetou: </b>Yeah, it's a 3GS. And on top of this A-frame, I try to stay as high level as possible because I wish I give a workshop to kids in challenging school next week, and I want them to play with this, to play with video objects, but also say, Oh, your thing is shit, I don't like it. I want to do better. I'm like, Yeah, please do it.<br><br><b>Patrick Lichty: </b>A couple of things that go into this is that on one hand, I mean, I won't go back in so much to the architectural matter, but you know, it's<b> it gets really interesting when you get into the notion of space that is just solid affordance,</b> you know, and in other words, there isn't anything that that isn't an affordance. Which brings me over to old browser metaphor is like Steve Holsten's perspective, you and Danny Brown's Doodle Box and Roy Stringer's. Nava Hedren. And, you know, I mean, you know, they they they don't necessarily apply to this, but I think maybe perspective you does a bit. <br>	I work with a multimedia program called Touch Designer. And I think one thing that's really interesting about it is that you create patches for the manipulation of media, a fractal, you know, And so you go in down into one patch, it opens up, there's a bunch of patches within patches, within the patches. On one hand, it's very elegant, but also it takes a little while to learn. The thing that I think about is that let's see here, I think about<b> affordance gesture </b>things like was it John under Kepler's interface for that he designed for minority report and you know, where all these gestures and all these things, you know, basically deal with all these different parameters and how rich experience that can be and pretty pretty quickly accessible. So I mean, things like going and touching the book and pressing into it to maybe open it up and have the have have the component parts of it. And then and then maybe then swipe over to and then swipe over to a connection. I think this this notion of of, of, of gesture within these spaces is, is affordance and gesture is really interesting, you know, because that's that was the revolution that came from IO came from the iPhone. And you know, this this notion of, you know, virtual libraries and such as as being somewhere between the metaphor of of the libraries that exists and a completely new form I think is really interesting. And then how how accessible is it?<br><b>Fabien Benetou: </b>I'm as parsimonious with gestures as I can, because I worry a little bit that it can become tricky to learn. And I'm a terrible dancer so I can move in space. But there are too many steps I'm going to step on someone else. Tools. So that's not ideal. It's maybe also the excuse for the parametric aspects, like how can we in the end combine both? Because I think if it becomes powerful when it becomes a grammar so that you can combine, let's say, one gesture with another rather than just a list, an extremely long list of gestures. But I don't have an answer to this. That's to me very much at the exploratory aspects. I'm I'm not sure how to do this yet.<br><b>Patrick Lichty: </b>I think I think, you know, I think a lot of our smart devices, you know, really, except for swipe, tap, you know, in other words, just maybe about a, you know, a scant handful of gestures, I think that they've really brought forth a really rich set of affordances, I think. I think as was spoken of earlier, the idea is that a with Frode and talking about the Reader is the idea that having an elegant interface experience is just it's really it's very difficult because finding the most elegant, simple, sensible thing is not always the most obvious.<br><b>Fabien Benetou: </b>But one of the things I've partly done, but I just was exploratory is. So you you have the keyboard you start to type in VR and I did a warmup exercise. So you type a sentence like, I don't know, I should eat more vegetables. And then you did it. Measure how long it takes for you, Let's say 10 seconds, because it's kind of awkward. You don't really see your keyboard. And you can also do it by pinching at individual letters. And then you do it a second time, time and every time you compete with yourself, like how quickly do you do it? So basically the goal there is to say when you have a type of interaction, you you need to become efficient with your environment so that it becomes natural in one way, just like little challenges here and there. So I think that could be a way where instead of just seeing instruction on the side, you have couple of games or challenges or exercise initially at the very beginning of each session, but then gradually less and less when you have, let's say, a certain threshold of efficiency, you find this sufficient for you. So that that's an easy way to to try to to do that.<br><br><b>Fabien Benetou: </b>A quick thing also that I two things that I think that I did not show properly and that are interesting is even with simple like the most basic of pinching with an object and grabbing it. One thing that I did not show, but it's you have your the object and the container. So if you put your thing in a container and that container can be transparent, you already move things in space and you can interact with it, including one of them was you text, text and<b> you put it on your back of your wristwatch, the virtual one, and then that becomes a shortcut. </b>So just pinching and dropping on a defined predefined, understandable area, you can really already go a long way and make it visual so that you should always have visual feedback, which is not something I've shown today. Like when you do this or when you do to pinch and you have a distance, it should show that distance or when you select a thing, it should make it transparent because that that helps to gain confidence in the gesture you're learning or and but that wasn't true.<br><br><b>Brandel Zachernuk: </b>I really like this. Obviously, it's something that we've been talking about for a while. One of the things that came through to me looking at it this time is like you already mentioned that it's on the web,<b> it's made with web technologies.</b> But I think that it's important to recognize how intrinsically web it is as an approach to these things, not only as it made out of those technologies, but it's born of the sensibility of the web and that it has a that it's not an application in the sense of being applied to a single thing, but sort of the creation of a latent space for our range of applications and functions. And I every time I consider not using the web for, frankly, anything, I find the. The idea that an app would then have to then be one thing so contemptible that it always leads me back to the web. So I'm really excited by such a web approach to being able to do a range of things inside a single space, having a scratch pad or an environment that that if you were to characterize what it was for in practice, you know, your desk in real life is has a whole bunch of things on it for the most part that that are for a little bit is for those a little bit is for that. A little bit is for that. And I feel like that's a crucial messiness and intermediary state that's going to be really valuable for us to capture. And I think that the web is the absolute least worst place to do that. So I like that. I could see myself sort of having lots of things on the go in a single space that they can sort of borrow from each other in terms of how we use it. So that that part is something that's especially exciting for me today.<br><b>Fabien Benetou: </b>I can highlight a couple of more things, but it's probably more 'webby' than most people think because you see the display in the browser when I load the VR headset. So then you can see it's webby, but the all the comments. So the things I pinch, they are stored on the wiki. There is not some of them are stored on the page because I want faster for me to check, but most of them are stored on the wiki so it means you can access this with a normal 2D browser modified. You can share that page with someone else. You can exclude it in another page of the wiki. Some data I mentioned it last during the last meeting is stored in webdav so you can export a file and then people can grab it, use it right away in a directory or with subdirectory, which is also web based. It's you have your URL parameters. So one thing that I have on another little notebook can't see right now, it's when I go to bed and I don't bring my phone with me and I take a little nap because that's where I get some ideas. When I'm the border of consciousness and unconsciousness or dreams, I don't know. And one of the things I wrote just earlier today, you can't really read it, but it's the action equal WebEx, or so that I can add at the end of every single page of my wiki, which is 1200 pages, that action. And it means every single page would be preloaded on that environment. It could also each of them, let's say based on category or groups, would have a certain set of action. And I haven't done it because I was focusing on the presentation, but I'm pretty confident it's going to take me, let's say, a whole hour to do it, not more because it's web based, because everything there is connected, because that content is accessible and efficiently. So it's yeah I it's it would make. I cannot think of it another way basically.<br><br><b>Andreea Ion Cojocaru: </b>I wanted to add one more thing.<b> The most fascinating thing to me about the discussions in the group is how it's to just see how all of our different backgrounds give us such drastically different starting points.</b> <br>	So I could see that Fabian's background is in coding. So the way he's approaching the issue is by making the coding visible. Frode email Earlier today he mentioned that his background is in human computer interaction and ergonomics, and then he talks about screens and sitting on a chair and reaching from a chair. <br>	My background is in architecture, so everything we're talking about is some kind of room and I'm always moving from one room to another. So whenever you guys talk about headlines and text and how we specialize this, I'm almost I almost have a hard time following because I'm just seeing every article and every word and every page as a space. So it's very interesting what our different starting points are is fascinating. And then in this context, if we do pull off the demo day in the spring or summer, whenever that is, I do think it's going to be so crucial to come into the room and everyone has to. I would almost I would almost rephrase fraud's call for us to to lay out our vision or where we think the future is in terms of first, we lay out what our starting point is like, what what's the methodology and the background we all bring to the table and what's our default starting point and then what the future is and in this demo day. I'm really looking forward to have something like Fabians there, which is such a such a particular approach about making the code visible. And then we've been working on a Bogosian library where where we have an infinite 3D lattice of dodecahedron, which fit into each dodecahedron, fits into a nine by nine by nine meter space. And you literally carve your way like a mole through this, through this 3D lattice of dodecahedron. And each dodecahedron is like, you know, nine by nine by nine, and it has certain information so you could upload text or images or whatever. So our approach is architects is completely about. Space and navigating through space and nothing else. That's where we start. So having all of these approaches side by side and then having having this discussion is going to be something that I feel like it's so enriching because the the kind of things Fabian is talking about, I would have never in a million years thought of starting there. I have to start with moving through an infinity of dodecahedron because that's just kind of what my mind is, is what's the default for me. So, so thank you so much. Far beyond for this. And like everyone, this is really fascinating because I think ultimately it's about what is our process of getting to where we want to get because we all know we're not there.<b> So in a way, these discussions for me are weaving through these different backgrounds and starting points and assumptions to perhaps come together.</b><br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>I think that is extremely important and I'm very, very happy to hear you say that. When I started this journey myself, it was Mac versus PC. I thought Mac was best. One day I realized they're both awful. Many, many years ago, 1990, once I developed my own personal philosophy, while not trying to talk to anyone else, I realized it's not enough to be a fan of Steve Jobs or whoever. It's really important to go back to before what was implemented. And the reason I'm saying that is so much of Doug and Ted and other's work never happened. Of course not. It would always be like that. And that is why I think it is so extremely important that we write down exactly what you said. You know, where are we coming from? You're coming from an architectural perspective. I want this book to help someone in five or ten years by going back and thinking people who are not with you respect Brandel polluted with the Apple VR headset or whatever it will be. You know, we will the future generations. We are the last generation ever to grow up without that headset. Now, the Quest Pro, which I'm lucky enough to have now, is such an intermediary object. It's not really there, but the people in the future, they need to look at what we thought about.<br>	So to include what you said of how we approach this, I mean, for me, document, document, document, nice typography and make it interactive. That's my narrow minded perspective to start with, you know, to make it really clear. That would be a beautiful addition to the book instead of just writing, blah, blah, blah. I think so. And so and to having a few key words, because we've discussed very often in this community how keywords don't say much, but to actually have a piece for each one of you by your article saying. Please note I come at this from an architecture perspective. To me, there is no such thing as a background. You know, and then Fabian coming, as he said, and then so on. That would be so absolutely amazing. So there's only so many calls I can do to the community saying another sentence and other perspectives. Another thing. But you said it here, Andrea. And for those who are available in the chat now or who will be watching, please do it. That would be. That would be really nice. Yeah, that was just me waffling on about that.<br><br><b>Fabien Benetou: </b>First of all, if all of you were software engineers working in video, I wouldn't be here. I wouldn't find that interesting. I mean, I also do this sometimes I go with quote unquote, my people and it's not as enriching. So that's that's the point, even though it's hard to see where we come from. Also, when when we say I don't know, when we say space, what space means for each of us is very different. It can be the space between two words. It can be physical space and can be space on a hard disk. It can be so many ways to interpret it. So that's that's tricky, but I think that's valuable. And a lot of the things I have in the in the book, some things about thinking about thoughts, but from a purely artistic perspective, nothing has to be done. Something about the design process in architecture because I'm not an architect. Some things just to make me dream like living in the forest, what it is to even if restless in design from an architect perspective, things just for beauty like generative design, how you can make things look pretty for the heck of it. And recently the the drawing thought that Adam recommended that Mark recommended on on learning thinking by doing on how to take the time to put it on a medium. I also what my I'm still bad dancer and bad artist. I can again draw a potato but I still find that extremely valuable and it's through those different interaction and sometimes honestly, even misunderstanding. Sometimes I think I understand what you all are saying and I don't. But I still have something hopefully creative to build out of it. That's what makes it valuable.<b> So yeah, thanks for being here.</b><br><br><b>Mark Anderson: </b>Fabian, this book, some interesting looking books you held up there are those on your list of references for the meeting? No, but I will end them. That that's fine. As long as there's enough. You know something, and then I can look it up. Some things that I thought I might take an interest in. I found this very interesting because especially when I was listening to Andrea's reflection earlier and thinking, realize what a particularly different perspective I come from. One I struggle to describe because it doesn't fit in our standard structure. I mean, I suppose in some sense I'm a hyper textualist, but as <b>someone said to me the other day, well, you're really a knowledge whisperer,</b> which I thought actually was a slightly grandiose term, but in the sense actually most of my thing is actually making sense out of other people's information. So looking for connections is building. But but, but it isn't and has never been building onto logical structures, stuff you make with software. In fact, I recall in horror every time I'm asked to put things in boxes and until there is a story and that's something that I suppose that defines my point of view. So whilst I'm for instance, I things like Bob's approach I find really interesting, but a lot of a lot of time, my, my mind is one stage before that.<br>	And I suppose my frustration here is that I've spent enough time close enough to software to know how hard it is to build stuff. And I'm also sort of gently despairing of just how far we are from tools being of the level where I can do the things I want to do with them because I don't know. Everything has got to be constructed and what I want to be able to do is to have have a sufficient structure that I can then tear that structure apart because actually once I do, what I want to do is to sort of take things and treat like a jigsaw. I don't care whether it's a room or a wall or a picture or a cloud. I just want to throw the whole lot in the floor and start sorting, because as I find myself constantly saying to people, Stop making it tidy, you're just making it harder to understand, because I think we have a natural tendency to prettiness, which is fine at the end. It's great when we want to inform and we want to show a polished product, but an exploratory phase. The more I live, the more I realise it just gets in the way. And especially if you're trying to spot what isn't that be it the connections that aren't there. Or or a description or an idea that isn't there. So one of the things, which is why in a sense, that's why I'm I'm very comfortable with the idea of not I don't want I don't want a background, I don't want affordances of a construct because it gets in the way. It's just more mental, it's more mental processing, it's more visual noise to do the kind of things I like to do, which is not what everyone needs to do, I hasten to add. But the explain my point of view is basically being able to play with all these things, to take all the elements at whatever degree of granularity you need for the task at hand and look at how they fit together. You know, in, in a sense taking whatever it is and treating it like a box of Legos where there are no rules that says you can't attach a blue brick to a red brick. I don't know if that's informed informed anyone. But anyway, that's probably where I'm coming from.<br><br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>I think it has informed the discussion a lot because it really goes to the point of what Andreea said of <b>where we're coming from, because, </b>you know, you said a lot of terms that are correct for you that were very loaded for me. I can't work in a non preachy environment. If the Macintosh didn't exist, I would not be in this in computing. I could not function in a Windows. To me it is so glaringly it's like someone screaming in my face and I'm not joking. It literally is that I can see it has an aesthetic for a reason. But so that was a really good example of that. And then I have a request for all of you. Fabian Sometimes these discussions are great, sometimes they become sublime. When you talked about space in reflection of Andrea, that was sublime because, you know, we have a glossary thing in the book because of Author and all of that. And we talked about connections, connections, connections a lot because we have these things called hyperlinks. But the notion of trying to figure out what space means, what interactivity means, these are not, you know, fancy discussions over coffee with, you know, people saying rather, right. These are the most important discussions we can have. <br>	So the other side of that is, why do I want to make a book? Why do I not just want to put hypertext stuff on the web? Part of it is that date thing that I talked about.<br>	It has to be locked in time. But also it makes you have to decide as an artist. And we're all artists here because we're all developing ourselves. That's my definition of an artist. Take it or leave it. But if we can all write stuff down because the act of writing is an act of translation, right? You don't just take a thought and put it on paper. That's why writing is so fucking hard, right? I do like to write. I'm an okay writer, but I find it excruciatingly hard. So that is why I'm asking you if you want to write a piece for me to put in the glossary with your name attached or not up to you or whatever in the book, if you just want to say. I'm a typography for spaces, kerning, whatever it might be, to make these basic statements that are so important because it helps all the other people in the room navigate not around them, but with them, you know, they become kind of jumping points. So that was just wonderful. <br><b>	</b>I<b> </b>was going to say I'm sitting here at the Groucho Club upstairs where some of you now have been. You know, the notion of space for a human is so important. You know, being situated in Soho, which is where I grew up and now having seen some of you in this space to me is really, truly beautiful. I hope over time we can manage to get together and different locations despite our main topic being knowledge and virtuality. <br><br><b>Fabien Benetou: </b>I wasn't going to argue about time spent and interactivity and all, but I'll do it very briefly. <b>Every every single interaction I did during the demo there was timestamp so meaning when I was pinching somewhere it was stored in there. </b>So the same way on get in wikis, every single action can be timestamped. So in a way we can also reach a certain state of a document or even of an experience. I'm not saying it's trivial, might not even be worth it, but interactivity and past interactivity doesn't mean being lost.<br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>This is such an important point. There is a difference between can be and is like PDFs can have metadata they never do right. Google Docs Do you have these kind of time stamps to actually access them in useful form? It's just shit according to the Google people themselves. So I'm absolutely for the environment you're building. But at a certain point it's good to say this is where we are. Even if you just put a giant time stamp on everything and call it a version, fine by me. So we're on the same page. But I think it was initially a different emphasis on what we on the value we put on specific timestamps.<br><br><b>Fabien Benetou: </b>I'll be super quick. It was more back to Mark's point about boxes and I want to go in defense of boxes.<b> I think there is very little things more powerful than a box</b>. It was a little bit the point I was trying to say during the presentation in London about interfaces. When you put a box around something, you make an interface out of it and if it has little things on top or even a label or you can compose it with others so you make it manipulable. And I think what a lot of people don't get about the beauty and the power of programming is because any time you make an abstraction, anytime you make an API, anytime you make an interface like this, you make a Lego block. And then like a physical Lego block, you have infinite space within it, You play with abstraction. It's extremely powerful. And I think that was on my little notes after my quite exciting nap today, I was thinking about specialized knowledge management, how in the end, most of the things we do, it's knowledge management, but in space, physical or not, but also about embodied metrology. So metrology has the philosophy of organising things, including abstract things, making <b>categories, abstraction</b> and all that. And I think and I hope it's something I mentioned when we started the discussion, like, I don't know, a year ago, a few months ago, at least to me, let's say the Dewey system itself is not actually interesting, but challenging it for a better one. Or any time you make progress in metrology, even though it's extremely abstract, it sounds, I don't know, sounds completely pointless, but I think there is very few things that are more powerful than this. Again, it's the way you make the boxes and how you play with those boxes, defining those boundaries so that others can work with it. I think there are very little things more powerful than.<br><b>Andreea Ion Cojocaru: </b>(holds up book)<b> </b>Yes, it's called called 'Women, Fire and Dangerous Things. What categories reveal about the mind' So I would add, according to George, lack of categories are the most dangerous things you could play with because they organize our whole mind.<br><b>Bob Horn: </b>And you can't avoid them. Just like you cannot avoid background and foreground because it's the way it apparently our minds work in part.<br><b>Brandel Zachernuk: </b>But it's related to perceptual and cognitive limits that we have and the simplifications that we have to have in order to be able to maintain any kind of focus. And sort of it relates to people's misunderstanding of the limited ness of things like the default mode network.<br><b>Andreea Ion Cojocaru: </b>But does one of your challenges sorry, like that's exactly the kind of stuff we should not be taking for granted. It is exactly the most important things category is background foreground, which VR can challenge, not completely eliminate, but that's why I personally love this tool so much. Sorry. I'm sorry, Brendan.<br><b>Brandel Zachernuk: </b>It's why you're here. And that's why it's all such a pleasure to be involved in a conversation with you. I mean, that's precisely the point of the webinar, is that that the the sort of notional backward background or foreground, the categorical, any of those things can all be latent and conditional on the specific sort of mindset that a person has. They don't make the switch between applications, they don't have to do stuff like that. I wanted to talk about the messiness and Mark sort of touched on the necessity to be able to kind of pull everything out and dump it on the floor and sort of talk about something that I feel. So Patrick mentioned undercover and the Minority Report user interface. People involved in X are often sort of comically sick of talking about it because it sort of elided a couple of different things in terms of the function of the Minority Report interface and generally science fiction sort of interfaces as performance rather than interactions. And one of the things that I hadn't thought about quite as much until Mark's point was the distinction between computer interaction, use and use as performance versus kind of working, because they're both actually really important. And what Undercover is kind of pursuing with this work and Minority Report in Oblong Industries is actually performance. It's people getting up and being able to make grand gestures where the grandness of the gesture is at least as important as the sort of the notional impact on it. Whereas when you're really working with that one. And active preparers. <br>	Oh, Stanislavski, yes. Yeah. Like one of the things that is really important when you're working is that it's the instrumentality of what you're doing is vastly more important than the drama of it. Maybe people really like to have. I mean, some people have code editors that have sort of ground shakes and and kind of lightning crashes and things like that as they put every keystroke. And for the most part, people ought not to do that when they're on their own. And it's very much more a performative thing. And so, yeah, I think I really like both. I love drama and performance, but but I understand them to be sort of distinct dimensions. And so I would really like to to think about whether there are things in your space that can be fine tuned and tailored toward performance versus individual sort of and personal potentially even anticlimactic action. And to that end, one of the things that I haven't shown yet here, but I'm really excited about is that I've built a couple of vehicles and they are recently one, which is where you have a remote control car and you have your hands as though you're holding a you're holding a RC vehicle controller. And so you use one thumb like this to control back forward and one thumb like this to control left and right. And it's pretty weird, pretty difficult to get to grips with initially because there is no physical resistance against it. But the results are actually pretty sublime once you learn how to pilot it and get it around because it's so unusual.<br>	I've not seen anybody really try to use hands and sort of digits, moreover, perhaps as inputs within within x r yet. And so it's been a really transformative experience for me. And likewise I've also got an airplane and you do this with it. So to bank you do that, you don't you don't go all the way around because you don't actually have the ability to turn your hand in enough degrees of freedom to be able to get all the way round. So so it's just relative. So to hold on the level, no matter what inclination or attitude you have, you do that and then to bank you do that. And the intensity of your banking is characterized by the degree of your pitch of your role. And the same with your pitch and. It's. Like I said, electric. Phenomenal, transformative. And something that I think is going to be really interesting. You mentioned IBM that you believe that you're not a good dancer. One of the problems with that is that it doesn't have feedback. You don't have a sense of what it is that you're doing and the rightness of wrongness. And people who do who are good at that sort of, I think, develop that sense. Computing is going to give us the ability to get feedback of a kind that's legible to us immediately, no matter what level of skill we're at. And so I'm I'm really excited by gesture, and I'll put something together to show you something. But yeah, keep, keep that door open because I think that there are some really special things there. So.<br><br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>I'm going to a dance recital tomorrow. It's Ivan, the oldest boy who was staying with us. So I think he may have a nuanced view of what you're saying, but it's a fair point indeed. Bob, is your hand up from earlier or would you like to say something now?<br><br><b>Bob Horn: </b>I'll say something. First of all, this discussion has particularly the recent part has. Made has given me some sort of an idea that I would love to have in the software that I work on ordinarily, which is Illustrator. I can take a bunch of text and or images or text image combinations and with one command grouped them. And they then become a unit. And what I've realized I would love to have in Illustrator is a command that then pops those out, that is pops them out and maybe makes them a little bit bigger immediately. So that's what I've gotten from at least from the discussion of the space and background, something that would help me immediately because because that what would that do if if I could take a bunch of a bit of text and some images and make them bigger in front of you. It focuses grabs your attention and focuses things and enables me to to work on on that. And otherwise, what I'm doing, if I can't and I cannot do that now. So what I have to do in Illustrator is try to use color or make these things larger for a for a while. But then I have but I don't want them larger forever because I want them. I want them back in in their size. I don't want them to black out everything. But I do want either you to focus on it or me to be able to focus on and work on them. And the only thing I can do these days is I can zoom in which. Which destroys the the rest of the background. You know, without without having to back out again or change their color or their shape or or contrast or a number of those kind of things which which makes them stand out and focus. But that's a whole lot of that's a whole lot of work to do that. So I just wanted to say I appreciate the, the, the thing because this is a new functionality that that <b>I think we'd want probably want to I'd want to have in virtual reality as well. If if my murals turn up actually turn up in virtual reality someday.</b><br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>What do you mean, some day? We have one of your murals, at least incredibly beautifully in virtual reality, and we've actually learned quite a bit by having it there. So that was definitely a good idea.<br><b>Fabien Benetou: </b>At least to me that's a win in the sense that our first it's an interesting discussion in general and also when there is like, Oh, I didn't think about this problem or the solution of that problem before and it prompted even if it's for another medium, even if it's for an administrator, that's fine, because that's that's the objective of a prototype. It's not to convince that something is interesting, but it's a prompts for novel ideas, things that haven't been seen before, explored before that might be bad, have to be honest, but might make perfect sense. And then moving on to the next prototype and how it might also, of course, make sense in VR is especially inside, exciting. But it doesn't have to be, let's say, stuck in there. So grateful. Thanks for sharing.<br><b>Brandel Zachernuk: </b>Bob, just on a purely mechanical level, depending on the version of Illustrator, if you double click on a group, you should be able to end up in an isolation mode, which if you have the top menu enabled, you'll be able to see being able to jump back through and you see the sort of the breadcrumbs of the named groups that you have. So I can show you something. But yeah, yeah, it's, it is a really interesting way of exploring things and, but I absolutely agree it should be taken further as a, as a sort of a guiding structure. Illustrator is too, too big to be structured conceptually at this point, which is kind of a shame because it's a phenomenal environment.<br><br><b>Mark Anderson: </b>Yeah and I think, I think you could do that sort of thing in story space back in about 1990. It's just an interesting point. I was just going to briefly just circle around because I hearing a feminist comment just now, I when I mentioned boxes, I may have sort of given the wrong shading to it. When I say sort of horror, putting things in boxes, it's not you're absolutely right about the affordances. It's more people. It's more one I hear. I mean, the classic thing at the moment is the only reason we don't agree on stuff is we haven't found a structure that describes our argumentation so beautifully. There can be no no misunderstanding. Well, I think our attempts at understanding text with AI is proving that actually we're probably being overoptimistic there and some things want to be held. Well, you know, it's holding the idea with very, very soft hands so you don't break the egg within is is I guess what I'm alluding to. But I just want to say absolutely fundamentally agree with your point about the notion of a box as something that has affordances. Yes, absolutely. It's just that I'm beginning to realize also one of the reasons I think I come to this sort of with this very loose notion is I'm wildly dyspraxia at head a foot, can't play ball games. I'm a very slow left handed writer. And I've had to use I've had to work in here most of my life to keep up with everybody else. And there's no paper in there, there are no boxes. It's you just have to keep spinning all the plates. And I don't mean that in a multitasking sense, but it's just a different way of holding onto things. And I suppose it's that that spills out when I say I like to have things loose and play around. But I just circle back to the point that, no, I absolutely fundamentally agree with a really powerful point about whether we call it a box or thing, but an object is things for affordances, because that's a massive force multiplier. Thanks. Can I just say that one of the things that I've used in some of my mess mapping that's mis mapping processes with with with groups is <b>blobs, fuzzy blobs </b>to replace boxes in many cases because groups, individuals in groups are often talking about fuzzy concepts which do not have neat boundaries. Neat definable boundaries. Ever. And therefore yet we accept them as ideas. And I struggled for a while to figure out how to how to put these into something other than boxes. I tried blobs and I found that people are much more comfortable. And now when I say people, I mean the people that come to my groups, my, my, my miss mapping groups who are directors of agencies generally, or deputy directors of agencies, they get together in a group of 20. And I say we're not. And they say the the boxes make me uncomfortable, make me feel engineering and and that sort of thing. But you're blobs, you're fuzzy blobs enable me to comfortably talk to other people and also record as much detail as we need to generally, not only or anything like that, because I'm speaking now in terms of a blob myself.<br><br><b>Fabien Benetou: </b>So quickly here, that's also one of the reason I leave the code visible there. It's to show that this is a work in progress. This is not like a final product. It's not just to show, oh, code is important or beautiful or anything like this. It's the boundaries are moving, the proposal is shifting, changing. It's not like I don't know what to do. It's not that I haven't tried anything, but it's not trying to say, Oh, there is a perfectly shaped box and this is how it is and you can't change it. That's that's also not that. So I think yeah, either I like also sometimes people in presentation slides, they have like a template that looks like it's handwritten or it's like with a pencil or something. That is to say you can challenge it. And sometimes, yes, your box has to look like a box because you need to build on this and you can't afford to change the shape anymore. And sometimes, yeah, you're, you're welcoming, let's say, change. <b>So I think it's valuable already to think about the way you're going to present some potentially shifting boundaries.</b><br><br><b>Bob Horn: </b>And somewhere, by the way, back in, in the the notebooks that I keep somewhere, ten or 15 back is a whole taxonomy of which I call 'blob biology'.<br><br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>So lots of things. That are going around. I started this morning writing a letter to the president of ACIM saying I want help with visual metaphor, Digital ACM Digital Library. Considering the strong support from Vint Cerf and also from Ismail and others. I think it will be an interesting discussion because if we get their support, then we can go and get money so they can actually do this because they're busy. They don't have time to pay people. Why am I bringing this? And now I'm bringing it in because. My sales pitch on the notion of visual matter is to make knowledge objects in the form of documents. Interactive table. <b>I think that the most fundamental part of the universe is interaction, not matter or energy or anything, but interaction. </b>Something doesn't exist unless it's been interacted with something else. It has no size or color or anything. So a lot of what we're talking about here really comes down to how we can augment things. So the things we're talking about can be possible in the digital space. Nothing has any inherent value at all. You know, it's just literally a bucket of zeros and ones. So especially when we're moving into the virtual environment where we can argue forever whether there is a background or not. And that is an important argument, but it's still an argument depending on the situation. There is never such a thing as a default background. It's always computationally put there. So I'm wondering if there's any further comments on this, on how the dreams that probably are showing is showing all kinds of interactions with text in this environment. But that text, if it's only there by itself, if it doesn't have the rich interactive ability, it only goes so far. So yeah, just throwing that out there a little bit. And then I see Andrea probably has quite a different aspect. To come back on.<br><b>Andreea Ion Cojocaru: </b>I think I have something related to what you just said I would propose. <b>The key thing that is not interaction is movement. </b>And I'll give you an example. One of the things we're working on right now, we we're experimenting with what we call Alice. So Alice is what we call Alice. This effect where you shrink down or you become much, much bigger. So basically, we have we have a we have we have an entire like Victorian villa that we kind of do things with and experiment with. And at some point you go into the kitchen of this Victorian villa and then there is a slider and as you pull that slider you actually shrink to the size of a cat or you can go even further and shrink to the size of a mouse. So the moment you are the size of a cat, then we make you walk back out of the kitchen. And obviously the kitchen is full of all sorts of objects that have an intrinsic scale like tables and chairs. So when you see those things as a as a, as a cat, then you know, okay, I am I'm I've shrunk because, you know, the table has a fixed size and the table is big, so I must be small. But then we make you walk back into the centre of the villa and in the center of the villa, we actually do not show you any any objects that have a fixed scale.<br>	So we show you like marble sculptures and architectural elements that could be any scale. And the most amazing mindblowing thing happened and we were kind of banking on it, but we were completely shocked at how efficient it was. You basically go from experiencing this Victorian villa as a human, as kind of like a house, like a large, large house kind of experience of architecture, and you go back into that as a mouse and all of a sudden is like St Peter's, all of a sudden you feel like you are in another space, like it is not the same kind of space. It went from a domestic space to St Peter's Cathedral. So that is a fundamental shift in everything in who you are or what you are or where you are. Without us having done any interaction, I guess you can say the interaction was the button, but it was a certain kind of movement. And what activated that was first you moving around as a person and then you're moving around as a mouse. So, so I would argue for, for movement. Yeah.<br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>I would<b> strongly agree that movement is an interaction.</b> Absolutely. You change yourself in relation to the information and you change the information in relation to you. A really great example of that is, of course, Bob's mural, because on one level it's just quote unquote an information flat thing in space. But what we found that was so incredibly fascinating was that if you use your feet to walk to it, you need a big room. If you use a joystick, you get a bit queasy. But if you pinch grab it and move it around, you move it instantly. So what it becomes in terms of space, because visually it's a huge wall. But when you do this, even it becomes something else. But your point about movement. Absolutely, completely agree. And when you're talking about these scales this morning, I was talking to Edgar and I were talking about dinosaurs because obviously it's five and a half and he loves dinosaurs. And I have problems remembering millions of years time scales, too. And then I just realized, hang on a second. You know, if I if we're talking about having our demo day in May, let's say we don't talk about how many days in the future it is. We talk about months, right? We're talking about one level of granularity. If I'm going to see you guys for coffee in a few minutes, I talk minutes, I don't talk seconds. So we have already built in certain chunking. So when I talk about dinosaurs and other long things with Edgar now, I try to remember 66 million years ago was the Yucatan asteroid and dinosaurs started evolving about 204. So I'm just thinking about these numbers. 66 is not that hard to remember. But for me before because I wanted to relate it to other schemes just made no sense. So what you're doing by having the mouse view, the cat view and the human view, you're setting an easily perceptual understanding of what the different scales are, which is really, really important and useful because one of the issues we have with the book and the library, we talk about interactions within the book and then we talk about the interactions within the library and the wider world. And there were some comments way up here. I think it was Adam who said. Hang on. Where is he? Do we need a transitional space between our library sections and collections and so on? In other words. Without just having a literal rectangle of a book and books on a shelf and instead of just having text all floating in a space? How can we, Andrea, with your thinking and your perspective, manage the levels of scale between paragraph level, book level and library level? It sounds like a related problem.<br><br><b>Andreea Ion Cojocaru: </b>There should be 'spaces'. I agree with what you're saying that movement is interaction. However, we're dealing right now with a cultural context that is using the word interaction in the in the context of websites and apps and screen based applications. And when they are using interactions, they are not thinking about movement the way we're just discussing it. And that is what VR brings to the table. So somehow we have to shift that cultural context. That's why for me, continuing to use interaction is going to fall on deaf ears or is going to fail to bring to these people's attention or to everyone's attention that actually the key thing is, is the movement component that includes so many other things than pushing buttons, which is what how we've been talking about interaction in this context so far. So that that that's that's on that topic. And then something that relates to your question and to the earlier discussions. Because I've been trained to think in terms of space. That has brought about many interesting consequences for me, which is I absolutely do not acknowledge any kind of background. Of course, in terms of gestalt theory. Yes. Like you need you need to you need to understand what the object is with respect to everything else in terms of contrast. Otherwise, that object will not form as an individual object in your perception. So that whole gestalt psychology thing and perception, that's of course I'm not denying that. But for me, everything is in space. There is nothing. There's space that's closer to you and further away from you, but there's not something here. And then the background, because space is just everywhere.<br><b>Andreea Ion Cojocaru: </b>And and now. And now here it comes. The point is that. I think of everything else, including knowledge within this paradigm.<b> I think that knowledge is in a way boundless and there is no use sitting with your text in a neutral place because you're always sitting within a space of some kind of knowledge. </b>So so for me, because I'm an architect. The space. The spatial paradigm encapsulates everything as a container of thought. So. So yeah, I don't understand any background. I don't understand anyone sitting with some text in anything that's neutral, right? You're always in a space. You're just producing more space or you're defining more space. And then the problem of categories in this in this paradigm of thinking of knowledge space becomes one of where do you draw the line? And of course it's arbitrary, you know, since everything is based, we're just talking about where we draw the line, which is the process of, of categories and what is it that we want to box in. And my last thought is that actually my presentation, the dialogue between Borges and Vygotsky that I did in London, I know that was a horribly convoluted text, but that was actually Borges and Vygotsky fighting about what is a boxed in virtual reality and deconstructing that. So I'm really happy to have this conversation again in a way and have time to actually tease through all of these perspectives. Because the thesis of my presentation in London was that the most important thing we should be talking and arguing about when it comes to virtual reality and text is the process of categorization.<br><br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>It's definitely key. Yes. We have 4 minutes left, so we go 15 minutes over for once. Can who can make 15 more minutes.<br><b>Jim Strahorn : </b>I can.<br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>It will just be a crime against humanity to stop right now. Fabian.<br><br><b>Fabien Benetou:</b> I don't think space is enough, actually. It's funny that we we go you give example Andrea about a scale and it's of course it's something first it's something mind blowing that people will not use to view it. They go in of your space like, Wow, I'm somewhere else. And then, oh, I can also change the size of everything. But honestly, I don't think that's enough. I, I like to think of it as a causality bubbles. So basically every time you enter a space, it can have a certain scale. Yes. But everything you do, every direction you do, can have a different consequence. It doesn't have you can have, of course, a traditional physics model like the gravity here. I dropped my pants. What I have roughly on earth. I mean, I have exactly exactly on Earth. But if I do it in VR as a simulation, I will have an approximation of the physical model I have here. But it doesn't have to be. And it means every time we go in a space where, when, when we encapsulate a space in another in VR, it doesn't have to have the traditional physical causal model at that scale and it doesn't have to respect physics. So I think scale is definitely interesting. But I think what it shows that, for example, the interesting interaction between chemistry or in between particle in chemistry or human at our scale are not the same. And the ability to explore this is pretty fascinating, but it's something that it's not just scale, it's the different causal model and the one that don't even exist that we can explore.<br><br><b>Bob Horn: </b>I was just wondering, as a result of Andreea's comment, were you saying, Andrea, that that the our gestalt perception processes suddenly stop when you're in the different spaces that you're making? Or are they simply manipulating the foreground background goodness of that? We always have.<br><b>Andreea Ion Cojocaru:</b> <b>I think those processes are the same.</b> I wasn't implying that we're changing them in any way. I was just implying that. They do not for me become categories that can influence thought that the leading paradigm that I used personally to understand knowledge or anything to model these things in my head is not that of background and foreground and objects. Objects taking shape with respect to a background is that of is that of space. Whereas maybe some of what you're describing in other people is hinting at a paradigm of understanding the space of knowledge in terms of something that's in the foreground and it's seen against the background that is something or nothing or neutral and so on. So I'm just talking about two abstract paradigms of understanding the space of knowledge. So the space as in this kind of space being one of them and the other one being more like the gestalt model of how we read objects with respect to a background. So I'm thinking of them as kind of in a metaphorical kind of way.<br><br><b>Jim Strahorn : </b>Andreea. I'm an architect by training also, though I've never practiced. And I wonder if your comments about background relative to space would change if instead you substituted the word context because you could argue, or I would suggest that context is a kind of multidimensional background, some of which you can't see and some of which you can in terms of your mouse example or cat example. The cat has a different context than I might have. <b>But the context travels with the cat.</b> Even though the background might have changed.<br><b>Bob Horn: </b>The context travels with the cat!<br><b>Andreea Ion Cojocaru: </b>Oh, thank you for that. I need to think about it. I think, yes, something changes. Absolutely. I can. I can feel I can feel things shift in my head, but I. I need to think about it for longer. But thank you for that. Absolutely. I feel like we should have this whole conversation again with this perspective in mind. Like, what is context to? Absolutely. Thank you.<br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>I have to jump in there because that was just too beautiful. James, what you said about context travel with the cat. I mean, what does a movie, a movie I would say is almost entirely context switching. You're trying or reading a novel, you're trying to be in someone else's head to experience whatever's happening. Because the thing that is happening is usually straightforward. You know, you read a synopsis about a movie, you don't feel it, you know, why are you going through the movie? It is for context, right? I just thought that was nice. They would call it background in the media industry fits perfectly there in addition. So strange to see outside of a Tuesday gym. <br>	And Americans for being here on Black Friday and everything.<br><b>Bob Horn: </b>Well, that assumes that we're all consumerist, which we almost all are. I also I think, Jim, that's you have the quote of the day with the 'context travels with the cat'. It's just mouse and mouse. It's just too beautiful. And in one sense and I want to say that one of the things that that. <b>The the information murals that I make is an attempt to to alter context in a certain way</b>. The the one that that I've shown most often in this group is one that that has the context of a million years. I want to remind you all. Now, how do how do we show that in space? Well, I had that discussion with the managing director of the British agency when I had my mural only go out 40,000, a mere 40,000 years. It only went out and he says, no, no, no, it's wrong. And I thought, Oh, it's wrong. And he says, It's the high level waste. Doesn't get back to background level for a million years. And then I said, I answered in a spatial way, but you don't have enough hallway space in your agency for me to show a million years.<br><b>Mark Anderson: </b>On this mural. You have to walk, you know, all the way from probably all the way to Oxford from where we are. In order for me to show that. So, you know, we're we're manipulating these kind of spaces. Andrea, this is really an interesting conversation because we're manipulating the the cat is manipulating the cat and the context as well. And so am I in a certain way in the murals.<br><b>Jim Strahorn : </b>Well, and in that mural, what you did was essentially telescoped time.<br><b>Bob Horn: </b>Yes.<br><b>Andreea Ion Cojocaru: </b>In terms of at varying rates.<br><b>Bob Horn: </b>And all the context, everything that was in in the time, you know, a million years of of of geological change, think about that as well as climate change. A million years of it.<br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>Yeah. And that's really super amazing that that kind of time scale. I would recommend all of you to watch the BBC series 'Ghosts'. It's also there's also an American version which is not so bad. The reason is that the premise is this young couple inherits a house, she gets in a coma, dies for a few seconds, she's back again, and then boom, she can see the ghosts that are still in the house. But the reason I bring it up right now is these people have died in different periods of time. So there is a Stone Age guy, there's a military guy, etc. And the way that they play with the context of their different time periods can sometimes be really clever and sometimes quite awkward and stupid. Just saying there are many different ways where we can bring about the context and that kind of space, including in something. But it's such a nice program. Go watch it. We're running out of time.<br><br><b>Mark Anderson: </b>Just quickly on the context. I mean, that very much trying to me, context is as much sort of as I need in the moment. I don't. So in other words, yes, <b>things have a relationship to things around them, but in the way that I tend to work, they don't have to be fixed. </b>It's well, it's a bit like a fog of war in a game, a computer game or something you see as far as you need to. And you may not need to see anything at all. Sometimes you may see need, see a lot to understand. In other words, to better understand the thing in your immediate focus. But but the reason the reason I was to just circle back to phrase question about visual metaphor and it's important thing to raise is one things that come through very clearly from me of a year of sort of just talking to colleagues about visual matter is that I think what most people don't understand is, is actually about metadata, the reason being that metadata is something that's done by the man in the brown coat behind the curtain. Metadata is, oh yeah, we want lots of that much be accurate. But thankfully I didn't have to do that. And I think.<br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>Brown coat (holds up his brown coat).<br><b>Mark Anderson: </b>Yes, I was right. But I mean, there's a blanket sort of janitorial role. And having been an information plumber for a good period of my life, I do understand that's actually how people see it. But I think it's terribly important because if it's something just done by somebody else, which is where I think a lot of people's mindset is stuck, we won't move as far as fast as we want to have the rich metadata. The earlier in this conversation, we've said we need to get the sort of things we want to do in VR. And I, I don't claim to have an understanding how we move the needle on that, but I do think we need to perhaps get people to start thinking about metadata. Isn't what you put your put into your cool code that more to the point, your cool code is stuff all use unless there is good metadata to put into it. Done.<br><br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>So many things to mark. First of all, I had a meeting with some people today in a completely different industry here at the Groucho and tried to explain a little bit about the work and said <b>metadata is basically data that says what data is</b>. So in a document, you may very well have the title, but if if it can't be understood by a computer as a title, that's all it is. But you said something even more interesting when you talked about you only see as far as you need to. That is essentially so crucial to the kind of gamuts we're talking about, and that is gamuts. Now, one of my very first heroes in this industry is Bruce Horn, because he was the one who wrote the Macintosh finder and he was the first to take me seriously. So I owe him a personal and emotional gratitude to some serious degrees. After I did The Finder many years later for his own delectation, he did a new version which he called context, which of course really fits in this. And also he did something quite brilliant. And I had stolen this idea while I hadn't stolen, I did in parallel in a different area. So he thought I ‘stole’ it, which caused a bit of friction until I explained where it came from. It's called 'Sticky Paths' and his implementation is if you scroll in the finder and when you get to a folder, the folder will stay and keep scrolling. So you will have on top a continuous list of how deep you are. So we call that again, sticky paths. And when I had something similar in my system, you know, not with folders, something else, I got really annoyed and had to explain that in the fighter aircraft, the radar, if it sees something, but it's out of range because you can zoom change the range of what you're seeing, It'll stick it to the top of the screen. So if there is an enemy threat, you don't want that just to be gone. So it's stuck at the top. The pilot knows that this is not within this scale, but it's somewhere there. So that is I think those two things are incredibly powerful ways of this is where you're working, but there's other stuff that's important. You can call it background if you like.<br><b>Mark Anderson: </b>So it's like a dynamic breadcrumb trail in a sense. <br><b>Bob Horn: </b>Very good. I'd love to have that.<br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>Now that person Brandel are in the same company again. I hope one day to have one of these meetings with so many perspectives.<br><b>Brandel Zachernuk: </b>Oh yeah. I'll have to show them the sticky parts that are in that prototype. Yeah, I implemented that. The other thing about the breadcrumbs aspect of it is that it's sort of implicitly constructed in the way that that breadcrumb trails require at some level intentional gestures to compose. So, yeah, there are some really interesting consequences for being able to build that structure around the incidental activity that people have.<br><br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>Oh my God, Brandel You're really annoying because that's such an interesting topic because our book is so gosh darn big. Some of have you been involved in Conversations in the Community how to make the book smaller for specific purposes? In other words, <b>how to produce your own specific ‘bindings’.</b> And we have looked at ways of you select and highlight text throughout the book as you read it. Then get to a point where you're saying make a new PDF, but only with the pages that I've highlighted so you can share that. Another one we've looked at is making you PDF based on this single article. I can see that it also been looking at bookmarks. But then I can't really understand the point of a bookmark when you can highlight text and you can see that in an outline. But they still become really important issues for how you choose to purposefully say this bit is interesting for some reason. And then of course in the future how you access that. It also becomes a bit of this kind of scale and gamut issue, how far you want to look. But since we're running out of time and both in terms of today and in terms of the year, I'm not sure if we should have a full meeting in December, because how am I going to get it transcribed, Right? Because this needs to go in the book. But I'm wondering if soon you want to have a second part of this conversation, either an open conversation or someone else does an initial presentation like Fabian did, or what you would like to do. The aspect we've come into today I think really needs and deserves a follow up. And I say there's some kind of glitter coming from Sweden.<br><br><b>Mark Anderson: </b>Very interesting, quick interjection that comes to mind now that the original purpose of the original invention of Breadcrumb Trails was to work with, to mark to remind you if you'd visited this place before. So it's an early hypertext thing, so. Oh, right. It came here by a different path. And incidentally, you left the breadcrumbs sort of on the way which created the trail. But the starting idea has been lost to time. And what we're left with is breadcrumb trails, which are still useful for a different purpose. So a question of of context of of context being carried along with the cat and with the architectural spaces and and where and those in our own mind is really an interesting topic. This has been a wonderful discussion and there may be some other ways of of getting into it again. I'm not sure what they might be, but that's certainly possible.<br><br><b>Jim Strahorn : </b>I wanted me let me add a single word in addition to context, but as something that in my mind relates to context, even though it's the opposite practically, and that is the word <b>‘catalyst’.</b> I think of ideas as short word or text phrases. And in that sense, they trigger. Those short phrases trigger. A whole world of ideas within my context of knowledge. So that's where the catalyst that triggers, you know, one's positioning in the context of knowledge. That's why in my mind they're related. So I think it's a worthwhile.<br><b>Andreea Ion Cojocaru: </b>Catalysts in mind.<br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>I think of spark points, but I think Catalyst is really nice.<br><b>Andreea Ion Cojocaru: </b>But yeah. Yes.<br><br><b>Andreea Ion Cojocaru: </b>Just to add something quickly, I'm sorry to drag this on to what Mark said about bookmarks. So back to my my inability to think of things in anything but space for me. Something like the big PDA is a city, and if I like certain parts of the city or I like certain that the city has different itineraries and different way to cross the city and. All I need to switch my experience of the city is are good shortcuts. I don't think of cutting the city in a different way and reconfiguring it. I could, but especially in the virtual space, I could cut up the city and reconfiguring it in the sense in which you are talking about allowing people to read PDF certain parts.<b> But as long as it's very quick for me to have shortcuts, that's all I need. </b>So the efficiency of the shortcuts actually eliminates the need to reconfigure the city. So every day with good shortcuts, I could have a completely different experience of the same city.<br><br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>I think that's a very interesting thing to say. And obviously you're talking in a much, much better sense. But I just wanted to show you, as you're reading in the book as it is now [shows video of Reader’s Find command], you select text to command if it doesn't do a normal find. It takes the occurrences of the text, shows it with headings because those are like the districts of the city for context and so on. The sentence in black, the word in bold. So you can quickly have a look at who else talks about these things and jump around if you want to. I mean, how many people talk about Nokia, right? Only two people with this is the reason we have the timeline. It's a hidden context. Now you can say. I mean, I didn't search for that. I'm just showing you an example. But bam, it was a shortcut for the knowledge of more of that subject, etc.. So these are very, very rudimentary things. But, you know, it's fun to mix rudimentary and far out. <br>	Okay. So everyone, we do have these meetings every Monday and Friday, as you know. Feel free to join any Monday and Friday. I'm extremely grateful today for the new context that we were made all the way off. And I wish you the best weekend, and I'll see those of you who have time on Monday and we will continue. Please consider writing the tiny bit of if you've been on a headset and this includes you, Bob, because you've been there. What's an experience that surprised you a bit, and is there something you wish just on that single basic topic? Plus, if you want to do Andreas, this is where I'm coming from. That will be amazing. I'll put that in your glossaries. All right. Have a good weekend, everyone.<br><br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><center><h2 id="1DFF7525-6462-4A43-8ACD-32EB2D92633B">Beyond The Case Against Books</h2><br></center><br>Beyond <a href="http://futuretextpublishing.com/download/fot3-index.html#D84B5DE8-82B2-4DBE-A01B-911147FD352F">The Case Against Books</a>† one could ask, if books are not enough and if computational notebooks could be, then how?<br>	The most basic implementation would be to have text, like so, intertwine with code, like so<br><br><i>addNewNote("jxr loadPageRange("+ (Math.random()*100).toFixed() +")")</i><br><br>and clarify what the shared code is. As is the code itself might not be interpretable by neither the reader nor the device they are using to read the content.<br>	Here this single line is quite specific to the target environment, namely SpaSca†. That environment defines 2 new functions, <i>addNewNote()</i> (a core function of that environment) and <i>loadPageRange()</i> (a function specific to books and now computational notebooks or rather books with code) and the ability to parse jxr code†. This means this example is very specific. One should not expect this code to run anywhere else (for now).<br>	That being said it does demonstrate the ability to intertwine text and code in an environment where code is usually shown, e.g Ffmpeg† or Hubs†, as documentation but is not expected to be ran anywhere else, beside a copy/paste. The reader is thus doing the work of providing the environment to run the code.<br>	Here, following from past explorations running containers in VR† allowing to run code from any language, the compatibility of the environment is assumed. This is a significant shortcut but that could be overcome. As briefly mentioned in Principle† a <i>Dockerfile</i> could be specified, either entirely as textual content or as a URL. This means not only text, as code, to container to text, as result, would work but even visual environment, as shown streaming a container back to VR†.<br>Consequently this short explanation with this single line of code does show a starting point for considering books with code in XR.<br><br><br><hr style="width:10%;">Key concepts still to address:<br><br><li>ecrilecture or the misunderstanding that even "normal" reading is passive</li><br><li>current efforts in the scientific publication process, cf recent consortium found via Twitter</li><br><li>on the difference between being displayed versus executable</li><br><li>computational context, see Principle†, including potentially the spacialized one</li><br><li>here for example there will be no <i>addNewNote()</i> function in scope to run with</li><br><li>note that this example does require more specific parsing, e.g taking only into account code starting the line</li><br><li>on the necessity of meta-data</li><br><li>past explorations†</li><br><li>see live working example† <a href="https://git.benetou.fr/utopiah/text-code-xr-engine/issues/69">https://git.benetou.fr/utopiah/text-code-xr-engine/issues/69</a> </li><br><br><center><img id="65C4F660-1E91-4E9F-B343-C3F871940E45" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/16217478-06E6-4A95-90F8-CACCB3F14BAB.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><br><br><h1 id="01709D60-39AF-49D9-B1D5-B156F147CF12">Frode Hegland</h1><br><br><center><h2 id="573A4B40-2F87-4F7D-8CCA-6A81B045C303">The notion that ‘everything is connected’ is damaging</h2><br></center><br>It is true that in the sense that if you start on any street corner in the world you will be able to trace connections to any other corner in the world and in the sense that you can connect any person to any other through ‘degrees of separation†’, everything is connected. We could also say that every academic article is connected to every other academic article in the field and yes, this would be true, but it would also be to completely ignore what knowledge is: <b>Knowing which connections are useful, valuable and relevant</b><b><i> is what knowledge is. </i></b><b><br></b><br><li>Some connections are plain to see and easy to follow, like a bridge over a river</li><br><li>Some connections are between intermediaries such as a person at a crossing giving you directions, or one paper citing another paper</li><br><li>Other connections are not made explicit anywhere and<i> it is up to us</i> to see the connections and understand what the connections are.

We can also choose to connect ourselves on a deeper level where we choose to stop and smell the roses in the moss, feel the temperature fluctuations, enjoy the play of light on the greens and browns and see the colours of the clouds shift throughout our walk. We can also choose how connected we want to be in foreign lands, how deeply we choose to taste and question the food stuff we eat, listen to the different sounds and acoustics of different places. We can choose how we look at the people. We can choose to look at their most obvious affordances to us, who is a police person, who is a waiter and who is a taxi driver. We can also choose to look at their faces, their eyes, how they move and choose to fall in love with everyone we see, choose a deep empathy and accept we cannot understand everyone but we can love them for their simple humanity. <b>These are choices as to how we choose to interact. Active or passive. </b><br>	These are choices also for how we live our intellectual lives. We can choose how much space of our being we will invest in learning what our fields of research are about, how much we want to contribute and what kind of career progression we want. We can also choose to question the foundations of our fields. Or simply build on top of them. <br><br><h3 id="82C28E2C-06A4-46B6-8B5F-A02E2DF649EC">Interacting with Connections</h3><br><br>We can choose how we invest in how we interact with connections.<br>	In the Future Text Lab community we have also started looking at how augmented reality (XR, VR, AR) can help extend how we view and interact with knowledge, particularly with primarily textual knowledge. Every Monday and Friday and beyond, Mark Anderson, Peter Wasilko, Bob Horn, Alan Laidlaw, and frequently others who drop in when they can, discuss the futures of text, and Brandel Zachernuk, Fabien Benetou and Adam Wern discuss with a deeper level of immersion in VR (since they are developers), something we are all attempting to follow. In addition to the annual symposium this book is based on, we have guest presenters, including Yiliu Shen-Burke who also builds in VR:<br><a href="https://futuretextlab.info/"><center>https://futuretextlab.info</center></a><center> <br></center>Modern studies of consciousness posits that we exist as embodied and embedded systems <a href="http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=q8mfzgEACAAJ&amp;hl=&amp;source=gbs_api">(Seth, 2021)</a>. I take this as an indication that what is in our heads formulates the machinery or mechanism we have for dealing with what is in front of our heads and that <b>what is in front of our heads is no less part of us than what is inside our heads.</b> If you agree with that premise, starting from the position that if we have nothing to see, nothing to touch, we will not develop into functioning human beings <a href="http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=DNY3DwAAQBAJ&amp;hl=&amp;source=gbs_api">(Chater, 2018)</a> and as we grow and develop we will, quite literally, <b>make ourselves ‘at home’ in the environment we are in.</b> A child born in the jungle will have a very different experience of the jungle than a child born in a city visiting the jungle, and vice versa. We know from what we experience. <br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><h3 id="CDF55A80-B7C3-4DE8-9DC3-A2A8039D7C3D">Realities : Following Citations</h3><br><br><b>Creating citations:</b> In my own software ‘Author’ I can take a connection that exists in my mind, a connection between what I am writing and something I have read, and simply enter a keyboard shortcut, type the name of the book and hit ‘enter’ twice and I have made a connection for the reader, as I did twice above just moments ago. These are useful functions of the software to make me look good. <br><b>Basic interaction with citations:</b> If you are reading this on paper or in a standard PDF viewer you might see the numbers in [square brackets] and get the general notion that I must be a good ‘academic’ to cite something to back up my points. However, you won’t get reasonable access to what is in what I cite, unless you have previously read the work, and the citations therefore simply reinforce that you and I are on the same page. <br><b>Augmented interaction with citations:</b> In my PDF viewer ‘Reader’ I have build the capability, based on Visual-Meta and a suggestion from Mark Anderson, that you can click on the number in the brackets and a pop-up will appear with information about the citations, making the citation information appear at an instant. This is nice and useful but the best this currently offers is your ability to click on a link to see information about the book or paper online.<br><b>Further augmentations: </b>I am now building a system whereby what you see in the pop-up window is less information and more informational (author, title and year of publication instead of ISBN and so on) and there will (hopefully) be two options to click on: [Web] and [Document]. If there is a URL included in the reference section (and in Visual-Meta, which powers all of this) then you can click on the [Web] option to open the link. This will usually be for Google Books if it is a book and the downloads site for an academic paper (the DOI reference). This is nice but in relation to what this article is about, giving you a greater ability to deal with what I, as an author, state as being a worthwhile connection, this is still very clunky. I think of it as you working with broken (virtual) fingers. This is why there is also (hopefully, going to be) a [Document] option. This will only appear if the citation metadata (References and Visual-Meta) include the name of the cited document. <br><br><li>On clicking [Document] Reader will perform a search of your computer and if a document with the same name is found, it will open it. </li><br><li>If the citation included a page number, it will open it to that page. </li><br><li>If it included quoted text, or hidden ‘original text’ then it will briefly highlight it in yellow, to help you locate it on the page. </li><br>As Amazon proved, the difference between a single click to perform a useful action and a series of clicks and changes of modes is a<b> difference of degrees of mental freedom of movement </b>so I would say this is important. <br><br><h3 id="81C7DCAC-F957-4768-B459-18E3EA46C40E">Realities : Following Mentions</h3><br><br><b>Augmented Find: </b>The names of my friends and colleagues mentioned above, including Mark Anderson, were included both to give credit where due but also so that you can, if you use ‘Reader’, select the name and do cmd-F to ‘find’ all the occurrences of ‘Mark Anderson’. This will allow you to follow that connection to read more about what he has to say or to simply read what appears in the ‘find’ view. <br><b>Augmented Glossary: </b>Because Visual-Meta supports what we call a Glossary of Defined Concepts, you can also read Mark’s Glossary entry in a small box at the top of the screen. Any text in this view, such as ‘Ted Nelson’ which is bold, is also a defined glossary concept and you can click on it to read its entry. <br><i>	</i>(<i>The reason for the long-winded name ‘Glossary of Defined Concepts’, by the way, is simply that in Author we have cmd-D for the user to ‘Define’ a concept while writing, with an accompanying ‘Map’ view of the concepts and the keyboard shortcut cmd-shift-D to see all Defined concepts in the document, plus headings for context. When the manuscript document for this book was exported to PDF for you to read, this Glossary of Defined Concepts became a ‘Glossary’ since that is the accepted term for definitions inside a document but we wanted to keep the keyboard shortcuts. Hope you don’t mind, or that you have a better term in mind. If so, please don’t hesitate to get in touch.</i>)<br><br><h3 id="F88B8B17-E969-48B5-B690-FE7D7FCEF0A6">Mapping Connections</h3><br><br>The Map mentioned above easily gets overloaded visually, which is why connecting lines only appear when you select a node/term, as you can see on our web page: <br><a href="https://www.augmentedtext.info/integrated-concept-map"><center>https://www.augmentedtext.info/integrated-concept-map</center></a><center> <br></center>	Mapping connections is such a seductive way to deal with how we interact with connections, and we have worked on this for years and years and so have many other people. We are now working on improving how this is done in Author, including the simple act (for the user, not for coding) of scaling the view so that you can use a 13” laptop and a 27” desktop with the same view but see more on the large display, without losing anything on the small display.<br><h3 id="41DFCEBA-BF7A-4D0D-9411-D08A274E4B19">Mapping The Future</h3><br><br>The next step will be mapping in VR/XR, and this is where the Future Text Lab team has experimented in very interesting ways. We have found that while moving in VR can cause nausea, moving the world, or a work object in the world, such as a Map or Mural, with gestures causes no such issues, even though the visual information to the brain is the same. The only difference is that it was caused by an action the brain understood as a movement of ‘other’, rather than ‘self’, as Brandel Zachernuk demonstrated.<br>	We have learnt that reading in VR, whether as a traditional document, such as a PDF of this book, is pleasant even on 2022 hardware (Quest 2 and Pro) as well as text floating against a black or passthrough video background as 3D type, is nice. Someone even implemented a system where the user can read a paragraph at a time with a gesture, or through a controller–and here is the kicker–as either locked into a location in space (as with most XR objects) or locked to the user’s view. Imagine having a book glued to a stick and the stick glued to the top of your head. It’s quite an experience, including being able to toggle the lock to the space or your eyes. We are looking at what can be done while sitting and what can be done room-scale as well as while walking. <br><br><h3 id="ABAB5BDE-6542-412E-9579-7E10F189DED7">Metadata is Context. Context is Connection</h3><br><br><b>Connections in and of themselves </b>are nothing more than sticks on the ground, they point from place to place but there is no indication to why or what. The knowledge gained in our minds as we interact with them provide the context for what the connections mean and this context is also known by another name: ‘metadata’. I came up with the concept of not hiding metadata in resource forks or anything like that, but keeping the metadata visual at the same level of the ‘content’ of the document, since it is of equal importance both now and in the future (when what is not visible may be stripped out and lost). <br><br><h3 id="BA4F19B3-8314-47EF-AB22-F83848FEA967">Visual-Meta</h3><br><br>Visual-Meta, as discussed to some extent in almost everything I have written in this book, is not a format or a standard. It is simply an approach of displaying metadata openly as useful and important data and not hiding it as unseemly information ‘plumbing’. We use the BibTeX standard now since it is well known in academia but that is for practical reasons. Currently users can copy from a PDF in Reader and the BibTeX citation will be included in the copy, though hidden, for Author to use exclusively. However we are are now opening up so that when the user pastes into an email application or a legacy word processor the citation information is included, but in a more human, aesthetic way. It should still be possible to parse, since there will be clear distinctions between the author name, title and date of publication, plus a link for the user who receives the email or reads the legacy document to click to open the cited document straight from their computer if they have it, or to search for it online.<br><b>	Ted Nelson told me that he does not believe in the notion of ‘metadata’</b> he says all data is data and this is of course deeply true. I use the term to simply mean data which says what other data is. This is the basis for the core of Visual-Meta: many academic articles are missing the name of the author, or the release data and might only have the title of the paper since the paper was part of a journal. However, even when this information is in the document, it is written for human reading, not for computer parsing. Visual-Meta simply accepts this and adds a (‘Visual-Meta’) appendix to the back of the document where it spells out these relationships, in human and computer readable form, using the basic BibTeX format. For example: <br><br>	author = {Frode Hegland}, <br>	title = {The notion that ‘everything is connected’ is damaging}, <br>	year = {2022}. <br><br>Although this data is often in the document, it is not understandable by computer so this standard formatting makes it clear and unambiguous. One of the examiners for my PhD Viva was not entirely convinced that metadata which is in the document at the same level as the ‘contents’ of the document is still metadata. He does of course have a point. <br>	My concern with not having the metadata on the same level is that it can get stripped when the document format changes over time, the contents of the document is converted into a new format or something gets corrupted, but most of all, that this metadata is hardly ever added to the document in the first place.<br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><h3 id="958C178A-EDA2-41CC-B51D-D69F8C7060FD">Evolve</h3><br><br>What data is, and what metadata is, will continue to evolve. It is up to us to actively try to influence this evolution, as Doug Engelbart suggested with directed co-evolution of humans and systems.<br><b>	Our understanding of what we can do is tied to the mental and technical infrastructures available to us</b> and as we hopefully keep appreciating that this is the <i>stuff</i> we use to view and communicate our knowledge, we will keep improving not only the tools we use but the environment the tools operate within. Just look at my own clumsy mash of ‘Defined Concepts’ in Author and ‘Glossary’ in Reader.<br>	Therefore<b> we need to enter the forest to understand the forest</b> so to speak, there is a limit to understanding from a distance. This why I value building and shipping real products to solve real issues for real users. My background is that of an artist, having studied at Chelsea School of Art a long, long time ago. Now my art is making tools for others to express themselves and, as Steve Jobs said: “Real artists ship”†. Reader is free and Visual-Meta is free and open. I charge for Author since I need to fund development but also charging for something is a real and honest barometer for whether someone values it. <br>	I welcome you, if you use macOS, to try the software and to tell me what you think. <br>	I also welcome you to try the VR experiences we are working on as a group.<br>	To bind all the experience experience and future implementations, I repeat that we need to keep in mind what data we use and share because metadata is context and context is connection. Thank you for reading this.<br><br>Together we can develop systems which leverage the immense cognitive augmentation the written word gives us, with the interactivity potential of the massively powerful computers we all work with today, in the early 21st century.<br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><br><hr style="width:10%;"><center><h2 id="3C28EC6A-2D2F-4735-8B58-684E88268347">The state of my text art + the journey to VR</h2><br></center><br>At the close of 2022, the year before I expect text in VR (including AR) to take off, I thought I should take stock of where my own text systems are and where I plan to go. There are a few tweaks I feel are needed in Author, particularly with the Map, some extensions with Visual-Meta and minor but useful Reader additions. <b>What has become very apparent over the last few months is how hard it has been to envision text in VR.</b><br>	Historically the introduction of a new substrate took a while to be taken advantage of. This is nothing new. To truly take advantage of a new substrate, which becomes a new textual medium, nothing can replace actual use and experience to inform thinking and discussion. We are still struggling to use ‘traditional’ digital media to its full. It is no surprise that in the 360°, top to bottom, high resolution, powerful computer, high-speed connected virtual environment we are still barely scratching the surface. <br>	For reading, for me, it is about making the experience pleasant. This can be done mostly through tradition typography and layout I think. Although text (in the western tradition at least) is an operation moving the foveal gaze from left to right, this is not what the user has a mental image of: we do not read in the way of a Turing machine. We read with a mental impression of the whole document (however weak or strong) and we read with prior knowledge. We further read using different points of focus on a page, such as paragraph breaks, bold, and other layouts and so on. <br>	Basic writing, typing–that is to say text entry–is also good today. I really don’t mind what we have today, even the 13” MacBook Pro is pretty great. The way I have polished and polished Author for writing, the font styles, the colours and so on, have been polished primarily for my preference. Others have commented and have their opinions implemented, but the software is a testament to what I want for the basics. So yes, this is to a large extent done, in my opinion (for now).<br>	What I want however, and what I think digital text can afford and XR text can unleash, is<b> truly interactive text with flexible views. </b>This is not a new value or vision, it goes all the way back to my philosophy of ‘Liquid Information’ and the inspiration of Doug Engelbart’s augmentations. Most of what I will describe here<b> can and should be done in traditional digital environments,</b> which is what I have been working on doing with Author and Reader. <b>Hopefully XR will provide enough curiosity to make it happen and enough interest from then public to make it viable.</b><br><br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><b></b><b></b><br><br><br><b></b><b></b><b></b><br><b></b><br><b></b><br><b></b><br><b></b><br><br><b></b><br><b></b><br><b></b><b></b><br><b></b><br><b><br></b><br>	The innovation needed, in my mind, is primarily with <a href="http://futuretextpublishing.com/download/fot3-index.html#DEE2CD2B-39C1-48AF-B7BB-1AF2D897F4B2">Editing</a> &amp; <a href="http://futuretextpublishing.com/download/fot3-index.html#C7C7C4B5-A075-4C9B-8DB6-CA3A3EF75D3D">Research:</a><br><br><h3 id="9275C2B4-A326-44C0-A295-956D11EA5C5E"><br><hr style="width:10%;">Editing</h3><br><br>Once I have my basic text down, it becomes a task to extend some sections, shortening others and–this is the difficult bit for me–making sure that the flow of the text makes sense and different sections relate and that there is a coherent way to read as an overview. <br>	<b>I want to be able to write an executive summary ‘outline’ of sorts and make the document flow from that. </b>A traditional outline is not what I mean however. A Table of Contents can be an overview but in a normal long academic paper there is so much in each headings section that disappears below the surface. This is a question I continuously grapple with.<br>	To write the kinds of documents I want to write, where the executive summary really serves as a starting point to the whole document and should be self contained as a useful unit to read, with supplemental text should be written as ‘units’ of knowledge rather than laboriously written long-form text written afresh every time I write something, the document needs to be interactive when writing and reading.<br>	A workflow for this needs to be able to involve both the authoring and the reading.<br>	This is what I am doing with the ‘Defined Concepts’ in Author, which become exported as a Glossary to Reader (in PDF).

It is clear from my experiments in XR that simply having a massive display is not the answer, or many large displays, it is still an effort on the part of the software developer and the user to decide what goes where and how this changes.<br><br><h3 id="12F9AD27-1182-4935-A4ED-717EFC5ACD29"><br><hr style="width:10%;">Research</h3><br><br>Reading for research is partly about navigating a document for relevance, close reading for critical comprehension and to see connections.<br><br><b>Navigation</b><br>Reading for research needs better ways to navigate the document. We have experimented with many ways of doing this where the issue is how much of each section needs to be shown for it to be useful and not overwhelming. I have found that simply having an arrow key right and left for next and previous –as is normal now–can be augmented with an arrow key down and up, which will take the reader to the next or previous page with a heading, is a good solution. The user does not need to spend time analysing every page when scrolling through the document and does not need to guess based on a plain table of context, the pages speak for themselves. <br><br><b>Close reading</b><br>Close reading is aided by good typography and layout for basic readability and the basic interactions outlined in the section . Further work can of course be done here to really elevate the reading experience through giving the user complete and near-transparent control over the appearance and interactions of what they read.<br><br><b>Connections</b><br>It is also important for me to be able to cite easily and that means that within a community, such as an academic community or our Future of Text community, to be able to cite a document and have it open on click if I have it on my hard drive/cloud/system), not just a link to a website for download or to open a Reference Manager. This is part of the future of Visual-Meta. Already Visual-Meta allows for copy and paste to cite, but the reading and following of citations needs to be improved.<br><br><b>Other Perspectives</b><br>Research with highlights by authorities in the field, such as the highlight above. This is social annotation but it matters who did the annotating, it can be a like a DJ or curator and you can choose to cite a document with a specific person’s annotations.<br><hr style="width:10%;"><b>Xtended Reality for text</b><br>I can so easily imagine a laptop display extending into different displays to let me have at-a-glance access to at least the following elements one on each display, as discussed in my article on <a href="http://futuretextpublishing.com/download/fot3-index.html#CE742CC5-5D2E-42FB-9C75-494EAF8AEF93">Displays:</a><br><li><b>Table of Contents</b></li><br><li><b>Map of Defined Concepts</b> </li><br><li><b>References</b></li><br><br>VR gives us a much wider workspace, which can truly help some with editing and seeing connections, both in our own work and in what we reading for research. I think we need to start with the basics, allowing for traditional digital documents to be accessible in VR environments, with as much metadata robustly attached (of course I suggest Visual-Meta as part of the solution to this) and then have the interactions magically grow out of this document as our experience and imagination grows. Similarly, those who can imagine completely new textual worlds should do so, and in dialog we can realise the actual Future of Text.<br><br><h3 id="38ED45D0-78C1-42CD-BB10-CBA5A74A7B0F">Making it happen</h3><br><br>Much of what I plan to do can be done and should be done in 2D but although I have built some of it, it’s hard to finance more, partly since there is only a limited curiosity among users for different ways to read and write outside the Microsoft Word and Apple Pages paradigm and the Google Docs online method. Of course there are brilliant software out there such as Literature &amp; Latte Scrivener, iA Writer and The Soulmen’s Mac Ulysses. In my experience as a small, independent developer however, it is very hard to break through to actually show people another way, which may or may not be to their taste and style. As I highlight, in several places since I feel it is so crucial, <b>VR gives us an opportunity for renewed curiosity.</b> I hope I can make use of this for my own perspective, my own software, and for the whole community to get to the next level of text augmentation.<br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><center><h2 id="823C63DF-848C-40B2-8F98-B44715F0A13E">The case for books</h2><br></center><br>Fabien wrote <a href="http://futuretextpublishing.com/download/fot3-index.html#D84B5DE8-82B2-4DBE-A01B-911147FD352F">a piece on the case </a><i><a href="http://futuretextpublishing.com/download/fot3-index.html#D84B5DE8-82B2-4DBE-A01B-911147FD352F">against</a></i><a href="http://futuretextpublishing.com/download/fot3-index.html#D84B5DE8-82B2-4DBE-A01B-911147FD352F"> books</a> and here is my small piece on the case <i>for</i> books. <br>	Books, in my view, are intentionally bound collections of pages which are explicitly ‘published’ though not necessarily shared with a wider audience, at a specific time. Books are also self-contained though they rely on explicit and implicit connections to convey meaning. <br>	Explicitly published is important since they are not ‘forever documents’ like a Google Doc or that Word document manuscript you have languishing in your word processor. They are defined as being done, at least for the current version.<br>	The fact that they are published at a specific time marks them in the history of the evolution of ideas and assertions and allow them to be cited and for flexible views to be built. <br><br><h3 id="E2B2B029-CCD3-4F8E-8CAA-7348FAE6B8C1">Robustness</h3><br><br>Of course books should be able to come in many formats but a basic format of the book is that it can be self-contained and therefore, with metadata solutions such as Visual-Meta, can contain rich information about the book even if it is printed on paper.<br>	<br><h3 id="36C8EEF1-2843-4AFB-8A59-8DA20258345C">Book Bindings</h3><br><br>The fact that a books are bound is of significance.

Their edit of the book into a new binding could be just a single article, a single page or a collection of articles. <br>	If the book is in a series, such as The Future of Text is, then the user should be able to bind it all into one binding, should they wish.<br>	Or combine different sources into a binding, as a teacher might do with photocopies.<br>	Further, the user should be able to annotate the bound book as a book ‘DJ’ of sorts (yes, Disk Jockey!), where people might even subscribe to get that persons’ views of books.<br><br>And there you have it. We should not only share information as books or even journals or magazines, but books do have their place and I suspect always will, but their utility will change with what the technologies make possible. <br><br><h3 id="1CA2D58D-A844-4B34-A9BF-4E21D451BA4E">Future Books</h3><br><br>There is no reason books need to stay rooted in the past, they can be set free with increasing technological opportunities. We are only just beginning to imagine books which have special characteristics in VR, without being locked into only being readable in VR. <b>We will need to radically rethink what a book is, </b>what a document is, what units of knowledge are, how we share, how we archive and how we interact with books and documents.

This is because it is relatively easy it seems to use a HMD as a receiver of a computer’s display information taking over the main display and adding more ‘virtual’ displays when needed. The implication is that this is simply too easy and does not take good advantage of what VR has to offer. As a huge fan of the potential of VR, I disagree. Yes, it might very well be technically easy and yes, the future will bring truly new dimensions to VR, there is no question in my mind. However, <b>let’s not bury what it useful just because it is easy to build</b>–not everything has to be a demonstration of technical prowess. <br><br>A key issue is that <b>text is hard to read when it does not have a clear and plain background.</b> This is why text floating as a hologram in sci-fi looks cool but is not practical to work with. When you have a background you in effect have a screen. And that’s ok. It does not have to be a regular sized screen, <b>it could be a magically resizable screen which can go anywhere and be moved anywhere without physical effort. </b>Perhaps most importantly, eye tracking can allow screens to fade away when not needed. This can mean that the user can have the best of a focused writing experience-ore reading experience–but the user can look to the sides and supplemental information appears–without being intrusive. <br><br><b>Displays/floating windows of any size which can be accessed and removed at a glance, is huge.</b><br><br>The thing is, the way screens currently works is that it is <i>the computer</i> which generate extra screens for the HMD to access and display, not <i>the applications. </i>To have instant integration with VR/AR, <b>the windows should be on an application basis</b> or created through Web VR for extra screens on demand. These screens should also be addressable by the host software for display sizing and show/hide (based on eye tracking, gesture or other).<br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><br><br><b>This would allow me as a developer to have my software almost instantly available in VR and AR</b> in a more useful form.

What will definitely be useful will be to allow the user to effortlessly modify where the displays are and their sizes. For example grab the display by one (or two) vertical sides to move it. Grab by top or bottom to rotate on the x-axis and grab by corners to re-size. Simple.<br><br><h3 id="9FC56EF0-BC69-4B39-B7EB-517AB08E44F9">Size matters</h3><br><br>What testing showed however, is that while multiple and large screens add a powerfully useful dimension, interactivity will still need to be designed to make it useful.

One issue is that you simply want to skip to the next heading since you are done with where you are and there are many pages of text before the next heading for you to skip through–judging all of them on the way to see when the next heading appears–to find if the text section is worth reading.<br><br>I have made three brief tests using our book as example. <br>The issue is how to let a user jump around our book in a convenient way. <br><br>• A table of contents is useful but only if you know the author of the section (as in the case of our book) or if the title is very clear, which is rare.<br>• A table of contents with tags/further metadata is hard to establish and can get messy, though this is definitely worth further investigation, particularly in VR/AR environments. <br><br>• It therefore seems to me that the ability to jump to the next or previous heading, not just page, is of use. Several of our articles are very long, so if you are not interested in one you should not have to click or gesture multiple times. The short video below shows a test on this basis. In that video’s description there is a link to a version of only one page, rather than two page spread, and also a continuous scroll test.<br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/6hnr0jwT4kM">https://youtu.be/6hnr0jwT4kM</a><br><br>Anyway, thanks for looking at this. The point of doing these is simply that in VR/AR we are not free of all constraints, we have different constraints, which is taking us time to learn as we explore the environment. The potential is vast, and we are just calling our way to greater understanding. We should do fully interactive tests of course, but we should also do tests like this which is simply a mock-up of our book where I deleted all the pages which didn’t have headings on them. I think that this will be useful for Reader in 2D and might work in VR, but I don’t know. I hope there will be tests or mockups or presentations or pencil sketches from whomever is interested, because otherwise we stay discussing abstract generalities and that is worthwhile, but we should also try to be grounded in this new reality, and on the way discover what ‘grounded’ actually means.<br><br><b><i>Response from community:</i></b><br><b>Heading-by-Heading (and sub-heading) navigation is standard in many PDF readers</b> (like Preview on Mac).

It is akin to taking a picture from one picture editing program to another program–even though it’s the same picture, you cannot expect to be able to perform the exact same functions–such as special photographic filters.

Here are a few dimensions of metadata worth noting. Metadata can be data intrinsic to the a document, such as who the author is. This is primarily what Visual-Meta covers. Metadata can also be external, such as who has shared the document.<br><br><b>Intrinsic metadata </b>can be very cheap since it is often included in the manuscript, such as: <br><li><b><i>structural</i></b> (where headings are) </li><br><li><b><i>connective</i></b> (what citations are used) </li><br><li><b><i>identity</i></b> (to cite the document). </li><br><b>Packaging metadata</b> is external metadata which has been attached to the document. This be added at the point of publishing to give the document a category and so on. <br>I feel it is important that all this intrinsic this metadata be included in the document in as rich and robust manner as possible, in order to allow software to enable rich interactions. Without intrinsic metadata, digital information is as inert as paper.<br><br><b>Extrinsic metadata </b>can never be complete included in a document since the document may not even have access to this data. It can be as disconnected as the information that someone ‘likes’ a book, has visited a location or driven a car. This metadata is completely removed from the subject but the subject is what the metadata is about. It is important that such relationship metadata, such as the information that someone likes something can have very different meaning for different people and uses. For one person the fact that someone has driven specific car can be a warm memory, for another it can paint them as a potential terrorist.<br>	In terms of knowledge work, these differences can be as benign as knowing that two researchers discussed over coffee which is not necessarily in any resulting documentation, but it helps someone’s understanding of the development of the field.<br><h1 id="B4FC0F03-401E-44DA-9E1F-EA691833B59F">Jack Kausch</h1><br><br><center><h2 id="C4B30EF8-1B7D-4975-B27A-CD9A0108631F">Why We Need a Semantic Writing System</h2><br></center><br><h3 id="5B83EC3A-C513-4BF6-ADF7-1FD6217150C0">Can there be non-sequential text?</h3><br>â€¨The Greeks thought Egyptian hieroglyphs were allegorical icons which conveyed pure ideas. This interpretation was passed down to the Renaissance, and combined with misconceptions about Chinese language. In the early modern period, Europeans dreamed of creating a universal pictographic language which, combined with an encyclopedia, would translate all knowledge into every language in the world. <br>	We now know that Egyptian hieroglyphs are not just pictures. They also convey sound. The boundary between pictographic proto-writing and what we consider writing with a grammar is the <b>Rebus Principle</b>, where a picture begins to stand for a sound by a process of visual punning. This was practiced in an extreme form in early Egyptian history, and gave rise to the multi-layered nature of the writing system. The best term to describe writing systems like this is not “logographic” or “ideographic” but the Mandarin å½¢å£° “xíng shÄ“ng”, which roughly translates to “phonosemantic.”&nbsp;<br>	Both Cuneiform and Egyptian have the quality of conveying spoken speech alongside semantic classifier symbols, which disambiguate transcriptions. The convention for how to read Hieroglyphs is not justified against any one direction on the scroll or stela, but follows the rule to read “into the faces of animals” or in the opposite direction that all the characters are looking. Thus hieroglyphs can be read from right to left, left to right, top to bottom, and vice versa, depending on how they are written.&nbsp;<br>	However: every inscription is still sequential. Even boustrophedon texts from the early Greek period, which reverse direction every line, continue to convey language linearly. The reason for this is that speech, while continuous, is sequential, and text encodes speech. Text takes continuous phonological features and represents them as discrete symbols, yet the content of the representation remains sound-based. There is not, and has never been, a “non-discursive” writing system, like the Greeks once thought about Egyptian hieroglyphs.<br>	This is not to say that there is not great value in pictographic systems of representation which have no relation to language, such as Emoji. It is just that they are not considered writing because they have no phonological content, and as such they do not represent the grammar of natural language. Birchbark scrolls such as the Ojibwe wiigwasabak or the Mi'kmaq hieroglyphs can convey complex layers of narrative meaning, but their interpretation is limited to those already initiated into an oral tradition. What we consider text remains a function of what is speakable.<br>	We are entering an era that wishes to challenge the linearity of text. The distributed nature of the Web, and the “horizontal” potential of hypertext to link documents together, seems to invite a world in which the sequential nature of the printed book is altered. What this change amounts to is another transformation in documentation. The codex made very different social modes of organization possible from the scroll (indeed, it may have been partly responsible for the rise of Christianity) and printing transformed the relations between individuals and the book. The nature of documents, including how they are stored and disseminated, will now inevitably change.&nbsp;<br>	There is a limit, however, to how non-sequential we can make text in its own right, for the reasons discussed above. Emoji appear to offer an interesting alternative, yet for all their expressive power, like most pictographic symbol sets, they remain ambiguous. Icons provide an ability to convey certain kinds of information, and even establish natural classes. We encode them with the same standards as text, and they are treated as text-like entities. Yet metaphorical combinations of icons can have many interpretations, and there are too many things in the world to create an icon for every one. There is thus no small inventory of icons which will satisfy the constraint of being able to combine them into every possible concept.<br>	Our new tools have nearly endless potential for the representation of mathematical, particularly geometric, entities. Text on the other hand is dependent on standards which encode individual characters, and in turn influence how the text is formatted, and what interfaces can be made for users to work with it, i.e., to read and write. This is foreign to our visual interfaces, whether phones or monitors, which, composed of pixels, are ideally suited to displaying graphics and shapes.&nbsp;<br><br><hr style="width:10%;">To return now to the European dream of a universal character language from the Enlightenment: where such a writing system is similar to emojis and geometry, it loses many of the characteristics we ascribe to text, because it transcends the limits of language. It is non-sequential, <i>but </i>it is too vague to consistently convey the writer’s intent. Where such a writing system conveys linguistic and grammatical information, it is constrained by the phonological traits of each language, and cannot be said to be “universal.” This is the conventional text we already have.<br>	The answer is probably somewhere in between, similar to what the Egyptians discovered all those years back during the period between the reign of Mena-Narmer and Djoser. Some combination of sounds and meanings could serve as a mnemonic device to clarify both categories, and potentially integrate well into current speech synthesis technology. If there can be non-sequential text it will be found at the intersection of the visual image, geometry, well-formed semantic logic, and phonological natural language.&nbsp;<br><hr style="width:10%;"><br><br><h1 id="38AF7B03-A274-4F91-839A-5058E4A2CCCB">Jad Esber</h1><br><br><center><h2 id="63E6310A-AC1E-4A23-8B07-D0FB8F98C9BC">Journal Guest Presentation : 21 February 2022</h2><br></center><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>Video: <a href="https://youtu.be/i_dZmp59wGk?t=513">https://youtu.be/i_dZmp59wGk?t=513</a></b>&nbsp;<br><br><b>Jad Esber:&nbsp;</b>Today I’ll be talking a little bit about both, sort of, algorithmic, and human curation. I’ll be using a lot of metaphors, as a poet that’s how I tend to explain things. The presentation won’t take very long, and I hope to have a longer discussion. <br>	<b>On today’s internet, algorithms have taken on the role of taste-making, </b>but also the authoritative role of gatekeeping through the anonymous spotlighting of specific content. If you take the example of music, streaming services have given us access to infinite amounts of music. There are around 40,000 songs uploaded on Spotify every single day. And given the amount of music circulating on the internet, and how it’s increasing all the time, the need for compression of cultural data and the ability to find the essence of things becomes more focal than ever. And because automated systems have taken on that role of taste-making, they have a profound effect on the social and cultural value of music, if we take the example of music. And so, it ends up influencing people’s impressions and opinions towards what kind of music is considered valuable or desirable or not. <br><b>	If you think of it from an artist’s perspective, despite platforms subverting the power of labels, who are our previous gatekeepers and taste-makers, and claiming to level the playing field, they’re creating new power structures.</b> With algorithms and editorial teams controlling what playlists we listen to, to the point where artists are so obsessed with playlist placement, that it’s dictating what music they create. So if you listen to the next few new songs that you hear on a streaming service, you might observe that they’ll start with a chorus, they’ll be really loud, they’ll be dynamic, and that’s because they’re optimising for the input signals of algorithms and for playlist placement. And this is even more pronounced on platforms like TikTok, which essentially strip away all forms of human curation. And I would hypothesise that, if Amy Winehouse released Back in Black today, it wouldn’t perform very well because of its pacing, the undynamic melody. It wouldn’t have pleased the algorithms. It wouldn’t have sold the over 40 million copies that it did.<br>	And another issue with algorithms is churning standardised recommendations that are flattening individual tastes, they’re encouraging conformity and stripping listeners of social interaction. <b>We’re all essentially listening to the same songs. </b><br>	There are actually millions of songs, on ‘Spotify’, that have been played only partially, or never at all. And there’s a service, which is kind of tongue-in-cheek, but it’s called ‘Forgotify’, that exists to give the neglected songs another way to reach you. So if you know are looking for a song that’s never been played, or hardly been played, you can go to ‘Forgotify’ to listen to it. So, the answer isn’t that we should eliminate algorithms or machine curation. We actually really need machine and programmatic algorithms to scale, but we also need humans to make it real. So, it’s not one or the other. If we solely rely on algorithms to understand the contextual knowledge around, let’s say, music, that’ll be impossible. Because, at present, human effort, popularity bias, which means only recommending popular stuff, and the cold start problem is unavoidable with music recommendation, even with very advanced hybrid collaborative filtering models that Spotify implies. So pairing algorithmic discovery with human curation will remain the only option. And with human curation allowing for the recalibration of recommendation through contextual reasoning and sensitivity, qualities that only humans really can do. Today this has caused the formation of new power structures that place the careers of merging artists, let’s say on Spotify, in the hands of a very small set of curators that live at the major streaming platform. <br><b>	Spotify actually has an editorial team of humans that adds context around algorithms and curates playlists. So they’re very powerful.</b> But as a society, you continuously look to others, to both validate specific tastes, and to inspire us with new tastes. If I were to ask you how you came up discovered a new article or a new song, it’s likely that you have heard of it from someone you trust. <br>	People have looked to tastemakers to provide recommendations continuously. But <b>part of the problem is that curation still remains an invisible labour. </b>There aren’t really incentive structures that allow curators to truly thrive. And it’s something that a lot of blockchain advocates, people who believe in Web3, think that there is an opportunity for that to change with this new tech. But beyond this, there is also a really big need for a design system that allows for human-centred discovery. A lot of people have tried, but nothing has really emerged. <br>	I wanted to use a metaphor and sort of explore what bookshelves represent as a potential example of an alternative design system for discovery, human-curated discovery. So, let’s imagine the last time you visited the bookstore. The last time I visited the bookstore, I might have gone in to search for a specific book. Perhaps it was to seek inspiration for another read. I didn’t know what book I wanted to buy. Or maybe, like me, you went into the bookstore for the vibes, because the aesthetic is really cool, and being in that space signals something to people. This book store over here is one I used to frequent in London. I loved just going to hang out there because it was awesome, and I wanted to be seen there. But similarly, when I go and visit someone’s house, I’m always on the lookout for what’s on their bookshelf, to see what they’re reading. That’s especially the case for someone I really admire or want to get to know better. And by looking at their bookshelf, I get a sense of what they’re interested in, who they are. But it also allows for a certain level of connection with the individual that’s curating the books. They provide a level of context and trust that the things on their bookshelves are things that I might be interested in. And I’d love to, for example, know what’s on Frode’s bookshelf right now. But there’s also something really intimate about browsing someone’s bookshelf, which is essentially a public display of what they’re consuming or looking to consume. So, if there’s a book you’ve read, or want to read, it immediately triggers common ground. It triggers a sense of connection with that individual. Perhaps it’s a conversation. I was browsing Frode’s bookshelf and I came across a book that I was interested in, perhaps, I start a conversation around it. So, along with discovery, the act of going through someone’s bookshelf, allows for that context, for connection, and then, the borrowing of the book creates a new level of context. I might borrow the book and kind of have the opportunity to read through it, live through it, and then go back and have another conversation with the person that I borrowed it from. And so recommending a book to a friend is one thing, but sharing a copy of that book, in which maybe you’ve annotated the text that stands out to you, or highlighted key parts of paragraphs, that’s an entirely new dimension of connection. What stood out to you versus what stood out to them. And it’s really important to remember that people connect with people at the end of the day and not just with content. Beyond the books on display, the range of authors matters. And even the effort to source the books matters. Perhaps it’s an early edition of a book. Or you had to wait in line for hours to get an autographed copy from that author. <br>	That level of effort, or the proof of work to kind of source that book, also signals how intense my fanship is, or <b>how important this book is to me. </b><br>	And all that context is really important. And what’s really interesting is also that the bookshelf is a record of who I was, and also who I want to be. And I really love this quote from Inga Chen, she says, “What books people buy are stronger signals of what topics are important to people, or perhaps what topics are aspirationally important, important enough to buy a book that will take hours to read or that will sit on their shelf and signal something about them.” If we compare that to some platforms, like Pinterest for example. Pinterest exists to not just curate what you’re interested in right now, but what’s aspirationally interesting to you. It’s the wedding dresses that you want to buy or the furniture that you want to purchase. So there’s this level of, who you want to become, as well, that’s spoken to through that curation of books, that lives on your bookshelf.<br>&nbsp;	I wanted to come back and connect this with where we’re at with the internet today and this new realm of ownership and people are calling social objects. And so, if we take this metaphor of a bookshelf and apply it to any other space that houses cultural artefacts, the term people have been using for these cultural artefacts is social objects. We can think of, beyond books, the shirts we wear, the posters we put on our walls, the souvenirs we pick up, they’re all, essentially, social objects. And they showcase what we care about and the communities that we belong to. And, at their core, <b>these social objects act as a shorthand to tell people about who we are. </b>They are like beacons that send out the signal for like-minded people to find us. If I’m wearing a band shirt, then other fans of that artist, that band will, perhaps, want to connect with me. On the internet, these social objects take the form of URLs, of JPEGs, articles, songs, videos, and there are platforms like Pinterest, or Goodreads, or Spotify, and countless others that centre around some level of human-curated discovery, and community around these social objects. But what’s really missing from our digital experience today is this aspect of ownership that’s rooted in the physicality of the books on your bookshelves. We might turn to digital platforms as sources of discovery and inspiration, but until now we haven’t really been able to attach our identities to the content we consume, in a similar way that we do to physical owned goods. And part of that is the public histories that exist around the owned objects that we have, in the context that isn’t really provided in the limited UIs that a lot of our devices allow us to convey. So, a lot of what’s happening today around blockchains is focused on how can we track provenance or try to verify that someone was the first to something, and how do we, in a way, track a meme through its evolution. And there are elements of context that are provided through that sort of tech, although limited. <br><b>	There is discussion around ownership as well. Like, who owns what, but also portability. </b>The fact that I am able to take the things that I own with me from one space to another, which means that I’m no longer leaving fragments of my identity siloed in these different spaces, but there’s a sense of personhood. And so these questions of physical ownership are starting to enter the digital realm. And we’re at an interesting time right now, where a lot of, I think, design systems will start to pop up, that emulate a lot of what it feels like to work, to walk into a bookstore, or to browse someone’s bookshelf. And so, I wanted to leave us with that open question, and that provocation, and transition to more of a discussion. That was everything that I had to present. <br>	So, I will pause there and pass it back to Frode, and perhaps we can just have a discussion from now on. Thank you for listening.&nbsp;<br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><br><h3 id="DDD8F8F6-DB23-4F9D-9BA0-3E0EE7C89F4C">Dialogue</h3><br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/i_dZmp59wGk?t=1329">https://youtu.be/i_dZmp59wGk?t=1329</a>&nbsp;<br><br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Thank you very much. That was interesting and provocative. Very good for this group. I can see lots of heads are wobbling, and it means there’s a lot of thinking. But since I have the mic I will do the first question, and that is:<br>Coming from academia, one thing that I’m wondering what you think and I’m also wondering what the academics in the room might think. References, as bookshelf, or references as showing who you are, basically trying to cram things in there to show, not necessarily support your argument, but support your identity, do you have any comments on that?&nbsp;<br><b>Jad Esber:&nbsp;</b>So, I think that’s a really interesting thought. When I was thinking of bookshelves, they do serve almost like references, because of the thoughts and the insights that you share. If you’re sitting in the bedroom, in the living room, and you’re sharing some thoughts, perhaps you’re having a political conversation, and you point at the book on your shelf that perhaps you read, that’s like, “Hey, this thought that I’m sharing, the reference is right there.” It sort of does add, or kind of provide a baseline level of trust that this insight or thought has been memorialised in this book that someone chose to publish, and it lives on my bookshelf. There is some level of credibility that’s built by attaching your insider thoughts to that credible source. So, yeah, there’s definitely a tie between references, I guess, in citations to the physical setting of having a conversation and a book living on your bookshelf, that you point to. I think that’s an interesting connection beyond just existing as social objects that speak to your identity, as well. That’s another extension as well. I think that’s really interesting.&nbsp;<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Thanks for that. Bob. But afterward, Fabien, if you could elaborate on your comment in the chat, that would be really great. Bob, please.&nbsp;<br><b>Video: <a href="https://youtu.be/i_dZmp59wGk?t=1460">https://youtu.be/i_dZmp59wGk?t=1460</a></b>&nbsp;<br><b>Bob Horn:&nbsp;</b>Well, the first thing that comes to mind is:&nbsp;<br>Have you looked at three-dimensional spaces on the internet? For example, Second Life, and what do you think about that?&nbsp;<br><b>Jad Esber:&nbsp;</b>Yeah. I mean, part of what people are proposing for the future of the internet is what I’m sure you guys have discussed in past sessions. Perhaps is like the metaverse, right? Which is essentially this idea of co-presence, and some level of physicality bridging the gap between being co-presented in a physical space, in a digital space. Second Life was a very early example of some version of this. I haven’t spent too many iterations thinking about virtual spaces and whether they are apt at emulating the feeling of walking into a bookstore, or leafing through a bookshelf. But I think if you think about the sensory experience of being able to browse someone’s bookshelf, there are, obviously, parallels to the visual sensory experience. You can browse someone’s digital library. Perhaps there’s some level of tactile, you can pick up books, but it’s not really the same. But it’s missing a lot of the other sensory experiences, which provide a level of context. But certainly, allow for that serendipitous discovery that another doesn’t. Like the feed dynamic isn’t necessarily the most serendipitous. It’s it is to a degree, but it’s also very crafted. And it there isn’t really a level of play when you’re going around and looking at things that you do on a bookshelf, or in a bookstore. And so, Second Life does allow for that. Moving around, picking things up and exploring that you do in the physical world. So, I think it’s definitely bridging the gap to an extent, but missing a lot of the sensory experiences that we have in the physical world. I think we haven’t quite thought about how to bridge that gap. I know there are projects that are trying to make our experience of digital worlds more sensory, but I’m not quite sure how close we’ll get. So, that’s my initial thought, but feel free to jump in, by the way, I’d welcome other opinions and perspectives as well.&nbsp;<br><b>Bob Horn:&nbsp;</b>We’ve been discussing this a little bit, partially, at my initiative, and mostly at Frode’s urging us on. And I haven’t been in Second Life for, I don’t know, six, or seven, or eight years. But I have a friend who has, who’s there all the time, and says that there are people who have their personal libraries there. That there are university libraries. Their whole geographies, I’m told, of libraries. So, it may be an interesting angle, at some point. And if you do, I’d be interested, of course, in what you came up with.&nbsp;<br><b>Jad Esber:</b>&nbsp;Totally. Thank you for that pointer, yeah. There’s a multitude of projects right now that focus on extending Second Life, and kind of bringing in concepts around ownership, and physicality, and interoperability, so that the things that you own in Second Life, you can take with you, from that world, into others. Which, sort of, does bridge the gap between the physical world and the digital, because it doesn’t live within that siloed space, but actually is associated to you, and can be taken from one space to another. Very early in building that out, but that’s a big promise of Web3, so. There’re a lot of hands. So, I’ll pause there.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>Yeah, Fabien, if you could elaborate on what you were talking about, <b>virtual bookshelf.&nbsp;</b><br><b>Fabien Benetou: </b>Yep. Well, actually it will be easier if I’ll share my screen. I don’t know if you can see. I have a Wiki that I’ve been maintaining for 10 plus years. And on top, you can see the visualisation of the edits when I started for this specific page. And these pages, as I was saying in the chat, are sadly out of date, that’s been 10 years, actually, just for this page. But I was listing the different books I’ve read, with the date, what page I was. And if I take a random book, I have my notes, the (indistinct), and then the list of books that are related, let’s say, to the book. I don’t have it in VR or in 3D yet, but it’s definitely from that point wouldn’t be too hard, so... And I was thinking, I have personally a, kind of, (indistinct) that they’re hidden, but I have some books there and I have a white wall there and I love both because when I bring back if either I’m in someone else’s room or my own room. Usually, if I’m in my own room, I’m excited by the book I’ve read or the one that I haven’t read yet. So it brings a lot of excitement. But also, if I have a goal in mind, a task at hand, let’s say, a presentation on Thursday, a thing that I haven’t finished yet, then it pulls me to something else. Whereas if I have the white wall it’s like a blank slate. And again, if I need to pull some references on books and whatnot. So, I always have that tension. And what usually happens is, when I go in a physical bookstore, or library, or bookshop, or friends, serendipity is indeed, it’s not the book I came here for, it’s the one next to it. Because I’m not able to make the link, and usually, if the creation has been done right, and arguably the algorithm, if it’s not actually computational, let’s say, if you use the doing annotation or any other basically annotation system, in order to sort the books or their references, then there should be some connection that were not obvious in the first place. So, to me, that’s the most, I’d say, exciting aspect of that.&nbsp;<br><b>Jad Esber:&nbsp;</b>This is amazing, by the way, Fabien. This is incredible that you’ve built this over a decade, that’s so cool. I think what’s also really interesting to extend on that thought, and just to kind of like, “yes” and that, there is a certain level of, I mean, I think what you’ve built is very utilitarian, but also the existence of the bookshelf as an expression of identity, I think is interesting. So, beyond just organising the books, and keeping them, storing them in a utilitarian way, then serving as signals of your identity, I think are really interesting. And so, I think a lot of platforms today cater to the utility. If you think about Pocket or even Goodreads to an extent, there is potentially an identity angle to Goodreads versus Tumblr, back in the day, or Myspace or (indistinct) which were much more identity-focused. So there is this distinction of utilitarian, organising, keeping things, annotating, etc. for yourself. But there’s also this identity element of like, by curating I am expressing my identity. And I think that’s also really interesting.&nbsp;<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Brandel, you’re next. But just wanted to highlight today to the new people in the room including you, Jad. This community, at the moment, is really leaning towards AR and VR. But in a couple of years’ time, what can happen? And that also includes projections and all kinds of different things, so we really are thinking connected with the physical, but also virtual on top. Brandel,&nbsp;please.&nbsp;<br><b>Brandel Zachernuk:&nbsp;</b>So, I was really hooked on when you said that you like to be seen in that London bookstore. And it made me think about the fact that on Spotify, on YouTube, on Goodreads for the most part, we’re not seen at all, unless we’re on the specific, explicit page that is there for the purposes of representing us. So, YouTube does have a profile page. But nothing about the rest of our onward activity actually is represented within the context of that. If you compare that to being in the bookstore, you have your clothes on, you have your demeanour, and you can see the other participants. There’s a mutuality to being present in it, where you get to see that, rather than merely that a like button maybe is going up in real-time. And so, I’m wondering what kind of projective representation do you feel we need within the broader Web? Because even making a new curation page still silos that representation with an explicit place, and doesn’t give you the persistent reference that is your own physicality, and body wandering around the various places that you want to be at and be seeing at. Now, do you see that as something that there’s a solve to? Or how do you think about that?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Jad Esber:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, I think Bob alluded to this to a degree with Second Life. And the example of Second Life, I think the promise of co-presence in the digital world is really interesting, and potentially could solve for this, part of. I also go to cafes, not just because I like the coffee, because I like the aesthetic, and the opportunities to rub shoulders with other clientele that might be interesting, because this cafe is frequented by this sort of folk. And that doesn’t exist online as much. I mean, perhaps, if you’re going to a forum, and you frequent a specific subreddit, there is an element of like, “Oh, I’ll meet these types of folks or this chat group, and perhaps, I’ll be able to converse with these types of folks and be seen here.” But I think, how long you spend there, how you show up there, beyond just what you write. That all matters. And how you’re browsing, there’s a lot of elements that are really lost in current user interfaces. So, I think, yeah, Second Life-like spaces might solve for that, and allow us to present other parts of ourselves in these spaces, and measure time spent, and how we’re presenting, and what we’re bringing. But, yeah. I’m also fascinated by this idea of just existing in a space as a signal for who you are. And yeah, I also love that metaphor. And again, this is all stuff that I’m actively thinking about and would love sort of any additional insights, if anyone has thoughts on this, please do share, as well. This is, by no means, just a monologue from my direction.&nbsp;<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Oh, I think you’re going to get a lot of perspectives. and I will move into... We’re very lucky to have Dene here, who’s been working with electronic literature. I will let her speak for herself, but what they’re doing is just phenomenally important work.<b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>Dene Grigar:&nbsp;</b>Thank you. That’s a nice introduction. I am the managing director, one of the founders, and the curator of The NEXT. And The NEXT is a virtual museum, slash library, slash preservation space that contains, right now, 34 collections of about 3,000 works of born-digital art and expressive writing. What we generally call ‘electronic literature’. But I’ve unpacked that word a little bit for you. And I think this corresponds to a little bit of what you’e talking about in that when we cut when I collect when I curate work I’m not picking particular works to go in&nbsp;The NEXT,&nbsp;I’m taking full collections. So, artists turn over their entire collections to us, and then that becomes part of&nbsp;The NEXT&nbsp;collections. So it’s been interesting watching what artists collect. So it’s not just their own works, it’s the works of other artists. And the interesting, historical, cultural aspect of it is to see, in particular time frames, artists before the advent of the browser, for example, what they collected, and who they were collecting. Michael Joyce, Stuart Moulthrop, Voyager, stuff like that. Then the Web, the browser, and the net art period, and the rise of Flash, looking to see that I have five copies of Firefly by Nina Larson because people were collecting that work. Jason Nelson’s work. A lot of his games are very popular. So it’s been interesting to watch this kind of triangulation of what becomes popular, and then the search engine that we built pulls that up. It lets you see that, “Oh, there’s five copies of this. There’s three copies of that. Oh, there’s seven versions of Michael Joyce’s afternoon, a story.” To see what’s been so important that there’s even been updates, so that it stays alive over the course of 30 years. One other thing I’ll mention, back to your early comment, I have a whole print book library in my house, despite the fact I was in a flood in 1975 and lost everything I owned, I rebuilt my library and I have something like 5,000 volumes of books, I collect books. But it’s always interesting for me, to have guests at my house and they never look at my bookshelf. And the first thing I do when I go to someone’s house, I see books is like, “Oh, what are you reading? What do you collect?” And so, looking at having The NEXT and all that 3,000 works of art and then my bookshelf, and realising that people really aren’t looking and thinking about what this means. The identity for the field, my own personal taste, I call it my own personal taste, which is very diverse. So, I think there’s a lot to be said about people’s interest in this. And I think it’s that kind of intellectual laziness that drives people to just allow themselves to be swept away by algorithms, and not intervene on their own and take ownership over what they’re consuming. And I’ll leave it at that. Thank you.&nbsp;<br><b>Jad Esber:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, I love that. Thank you for sharing. And that’s a fascinating project, as well. I’d love to dig in further. I think you bring up a really good point around shared interests being really key and connecting the right type of folks, who are interested in exploring each others libraries. Because not everyone that comes into my house is interested in the books that I’m reading, because, perhaps, they’re from a different field, they’re just not as curious about the same fields. But there is a huge amount of people that potentially are. I mean, within this group, we’re all interested in similar things. And we found each other through the internet. And so, there is this element of, what if the people walking into your library, Dene, are also folks that share the same interests as you? That would actively look and browse through your library and are deeply interested in the topics that you’re interested in so there is something to be said around how can we make sure that people that are interested in the same things are walking into each others’ spaces? And the interest-based graphs exist on the Web. Thinking about who is interested in what, and how can we go into each others’ spaces. And browse, or collecting, or curating, or creating is a part of what many algorithms try to do, for better or for worse. But sometimes leave us in echo chambers, right? And we’re in one neighbourhood and can’t leave, and that’s part of the problem. But yeah, there is something to be said about that. And I think just to go back to the earlier comment that the Dene made around the inspirations behind artists’ work. I would love to be able to explore what inspired my favourite artist’s music, and what went into it and go back and listen to that. And I think, part of again, Web3’s promise is this idea of provenance, seeing how things have evolved and how they’ve become. And crediting everyone in that lineage. So, if I borrowed from Dene’s work, and I built on it, and that was part of what inspired me, then she should get some credit. And that idea of provenance, and lineage, and giving credit back, and building incentive systems that allow people to build works that will inspire others to continue to build on top of my work is a really interesting proposal for the future of the internet. And so, I just wanted to share that as well.<b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>That’s great. Anything back from you, Dene, on that? Before we move to Mark?&nbsp;<br><b>Dene Grigar:&nbsp;</b>Well, I think provenance is really important. And what I do in my own lab is to establish provenance. Even if you go to The NEXT and you look at the works, it’ll say where we got the work from, who gave it to us, the date they gave it to us, and if there’s some other story that goes with it. For example, I just received a donation from a woman whose daughter went to Brown University and studied under Coover, Robert Coover. And she gave me a copy of some of the early hypertext works, and one was Michael Joyce’s Afternoon Story and it was signed. The little floppy disk was signed, on the label, by Michael and she said, “I didn’t notice there was a signature. I don’t know why there’d be a signature on it.” And, of course, the answer is, if you know anything about the history is that Joyce and Coover were friends, there’s this whole line of this relationship and Coover was the first to review Michael Joyce, and made him famous in the New York times, in 1992. So, I told her that story, and she’s like, Oh, my god. I didn’t know that.” So, just having that story for future generations to understand the relationships, and how ideas and taste evolve over time, and who were the movers and shakers behind some of that interest, so. Thank you.&nbsp;<a href="https://the-next.eliterature.org/">https://the-next.eliterature.org/</a>.<br><br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Dene, this is really grist for the mill of a lot of what we’re talking about here. Because, with <b>Jad’s notions of identity sharing via the media we consume,</b> and a lot of the visualisations we’re looking at in VR. One of the things we’ve talked about over the last few weeks is guided tours of work where you could see the hands of the author or somebody pointing out things whether it’s a mural, or a book, or whatever. And then, to be able to find a way to have the meta-information you just talked about, be able to enter the room, maybe it could be simply recorded as you saying it, and that is tagged to be attached to these works. Many wonderful layers, I could go on forever. And I expect mark will follow up.&nbsp;<br><b>Mark Anderson:&nbsp;</b>Hi. I just think, they’re really reflections, more than anything else. Because one of the things that really brought me up was this idea of books being a performative thing, which I still can’t get my head around. It’s not something I’ve encountered, and I don’t see it reflected in the world in which I live. So maybe a generational drift in things. For instance, behind me you might guess, I suppose, I’m a programmer. Actually what that shows is it’s me trying to understand how things work, and I need them that close to my computer. My library is scattered across the house, mainly to distribute weight through a rather old crumbly Victorian house. So, I have to be careful where we put the bookcases. I’m just, really reflecting how totally alien I find the notion of books, I certainly don’t have... I struggled to think of, I never placed a book with the intention it’ll be seen in that position by somebody else. And this is sort of not a pushback, it’s just my reflection on what I’m hearing. Because I find it very interesting because it had never occurred to me. I never, ever thought of it in those terms. The other sad thing about that means that, so, are the books merely performative? Or the content is there? I mean, one of the interesting thing I’ve been trying to do in this group is trying to find ways just to share the list of the books that are on my shelf. Not because they are any reflection of myself, but literally, I actually have some books that are quite hard to find, and people might want to know that it was possible to find a copy. And whether they need to come and physically see it, or we could scan something. The point is, “No, I have these. This is a place you can find this book.” And it’s interesting that that’s actually really hard to do. Most systems don’t help because, I mean, the tragedy of recommender systems is they make us so inward-looking. So, instead of actually rewarding our curiosity, or making us look across our divides, they basically say, “Right. You lot are a bunch. You go stand over there.” Job done, and (the) recommender system moves on to categorising the next thing. So, if I try to read outside my normal purview, and I’m constantly reflecting on the fact that the recommended system is one step behind saying, “Oh, right. You’re now interested in…” No, I’m not. I’m trying to learn a bit about it. But certainly, this is not my area of interest in the sense that I now want to be amidst lots of people who like this. I’m interested in people who are interested by it, but I think those are two very different things. So, I don’t know the answers, but I just raise those, I suppose, as provocations. Because that’s something that, at the moment, our systems are really bad at allowing us to share content other than as a sort of humblebrag. Or, in your beautifully curated life on Pinterest, or whatever. Anyway, I’ll stop there.&nbsp;<br><b>Jad Esber:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, thank you for sharing that. <b>I think it does exist on a spectrum, the identity expressive versus utilitarian need that it solves. </b>But if you take the example of clothing, that might help it a little bit more. So, if we’re wearing a t-shirt, perhaps there’s a utilitarian need, but there is also a performative, or identity expressive need that it solves the way we dress, speaks to who we are as well. So I think the notion of a social object being identity expressive, I think is what I was trying to convey. Think, if you think about magazines on a coffee table. Or you think about the art books that live scattered around your living room, perhaps. That is trying to signal something about yourself. The magazines we read as well. If I’m reading Vogue, I’m trying to say something about who I am, and what I’m interested in reading. The Times, or The Guardian, or another newspaper is also very identity expressive. And taking it out on the train and making sure people see what I’m reading is also identity expressive. So, I think that everything sort of around what we consume and what we wear and what we identify with being a signal of who we are. It’s what I was trying to convey there. But I think you make a very good point. The books next to your computer are there because they’re within reach. You’re writing a paper about something and it’s right there. And so, there is a utilitarian need for the way you organise your bookshelf. The way you organise your bookshelf can be identity expressive or utilitarian. I’ll give you another example. On my bookshelf, I have a few books that are turned face forward, and a few that I don’t really want people to see them, because I’m not really that proud of them. And I have a book that’s signed by the author, I’ll make sure it’s really easy for people to open it and see the signature. And so, there is an identity expressive element to the way I organise my bookshelves as well that’s not just utilitarian. So, I think another point to illustrate that angle.&nbsp;<br><b>Mark Anderson:&nbsp;</b>To pull us back to our, and as a sub-focus on AR, VR, it just occurred to me it’s something that, the (indistinct) reminder that Dene was talking about, people don’t look at the bookshelves. I’m thinking, yeah and certainly not saying I miss, and it happens less frequently that the evening ends up with a dinner table just loaded with piles of books that have been retrieved from all over the house and are actually part of the conversation that’s going on. And one thing that some of our new tools would be nice to help us recreate that, especially maybe, if we’re not meeting in the same physical space, is to have that element of recall of these artefacts, or at least some of the pertinent parts of the content they’re in. It would be really useful to have because the fact that you bothered to walk up two flights of stairs or something to go and get some book off the top shelf, because that’s, in a sense, part of the conversation going on, I think is quite interesting and something we’ve sort of lost anyway. I’ll let it carry on.&nbsp;<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>It’s interesting to hear what you say there, Mark, because in the calls we have, you’re the one who most often will, “Look, the book arrived. Look, I have this copy now.” And then we all get really annoyed at you because we have to buy the same damn book. So, I think we’re talking about different ways and to different audiences, not necessarily to dinner guests. But for your community of this thing, you’re very happy to share. Which is interesting it’s also two points, to use my hand in the air here. One of them is, clothing came up as well. And some kind of study, I read showed that, we don’t buy clothing we like, we buy clothing that is the kind of clothing we expect people like us to buy. So, even somebody who is really, “I don’t care about fashion” is making a very strong fashion statement. They’re saying they don’t care. Which is anti-snobbery, maybe. You could say that I’m wondering how that enters into this. But also, when we talk about curation, it’s so fascinating how, in this discussion, music and books are almost interchangeable from this particular aspect. And what I found is, I don’t subscribe to Spotify, I never have, because I didn’t like the way the songs were mixed. But what I do really like, and I find amazing, is YouTube mixes. I pay for YouTube premium so I don’t have the ads. That means I’ll have an hour, an hour and a half, maybe two-hour mixes by DJs who really represent my taste. Which is a fantastic new thing. We didn’t have that opportunity before. So that is a few people. And there, the YouTube algorithm tends to put me in direction of something similar. But also this is for music when I work. It’s not for finding new interesting Jazz. When I play this music, when I’m out driving with my family, I hear how incredibly inane and boring it is. It is designed for backgrounding. So the question then becomes, maybe, do we want to have different shelves? Different bookshelves for different aspects of our lives? And then we’re moving back into the virtuality of it all. That was my hand up. Mark, is your hand up for a new point? Okay, Fabien?&nbsp;<br><b>Fabien Benetou:&nbsp;</b>Yeah a couple of points. The first to me, the dearest to me, let’s say, is the provenance aspect. I’m really pissed or annoyed when people don’t cite sources. I would have a normal conversation about a recipe or anything completely casual, doesn’t have to be academic, and if that person didn’t invent it themselves, I’m annoyed if there is not some way for me to look back to where it came from. And I think, honestly, a lot of the energy we waste as a species comes from that. If you’re not aware, of course, of the source, you can’t cite it. But if you learn it from somewhere not doing that work, I think is really detrimental. Because we don’t have to have the same thought twice if we don’t want to. And if we just have it again, it’s just such a waste of resources. And especially since I’m not a physician, and I don’t specialise in memory, but from what I understood, source memory is the type of memory where you recall, not the information, but where you got it from. And apparently, it’s one of the most demanding. So for example, you learn about, let’s say, a book, and you know somebody told you about that book, and that’s going to be much harder but eventually, if you don’t remember the book itself, but the person who told you about it, you can find it back. So, basically, if as a species, we have such a hard time providing sources and understanding where something comes from, I think it’s really terrible. It does piss me off, to be honest. And I don’t know if metadata, in general, is an answer. If having some properly formatted, any kind of representation of it, I’m not going to remember the ISBN of the book, on the top of my head in a conversation, but I’m wondering in terms of, let’s say if blockchain can solve that? Can Web3 solve it? Especially you mentioned the, let’s say, a chain of value. If you have a source or the reference of somewhere else whose work you’re using, it is fair to reattribute it back. They were part of how you came to produce something new. So, I’m quite curious about where this is going to be.&nbsp;<br><b>Jad Esber:&nbsp;</b>Yes, thank you for that question. And, yeah. I think there are a few points. First is, I’m going to just comment really quickly on this idea of provenance. And I want to just jump back to answer some of Frode’s comments, as well. But I think, one thing that you highlighted, Fabien, is how hard it is for us to remember where we learned something or got something. And part of the problem is that, so much of citing and sourcing is so proactive and requires human effort. And if things were designed where it was just built into the process. One of the projects I worked on at YouTube was a way for creators to take existing videos and build on them. So, remixing essentially. And in the process of creating content, I’d have to take a snippet and build on it. And that is built into the creation process. The provenance, the citing are very natural to how I’m creating content. TikTok is really good at this too. And so I wonder if there are, again, design systems that allow us to build in provenance and make it really user-friendly and intuitive to remove the friction around having to remember the source and cite. We’re lazy creatures. We want that to be part of our flow. TikTok duets feature and stitching is brilliant. It builds in provenance into the flow. And so, that’s just one thought. In terms of how blockchains help. So, part of what is a blockchain other than a public record of who owns what, and how things are being transacted. If there was a way if we go back to&nbsp;TikTok&nbsp;stitching, or YouTube quoting a specific part of a video, and building on it, if that chain of events was tracked and publicly accessible, and there was a way for me to pass value down that chain to everyone that contributed to this new creative work, that that would be really cool. And that’s part of the promise. This idea of keeping track of how everything is moving, and being able to then distribute value in an automated way. So, that’s sort of addressing that point. And then really quickly on, Frode, your earlier comments, and perhaps tying in with some of what we talked about with Mark, around identity expression. I think this all comes back to the human need to be heard, and understood, and seen, and there are phases in our life, where we’re figuring out who we are, and we don’t really have our identities figured out yet. So, if you think about a lot of teenagers, they will have posters on their walls to express what they’re consuming or who they’re interested in. And they are figuring out who they are. And part of them figuring out who they are is talking about what they’re consuming, and through what they’re consuming, they’re figuring out their identities. I grew up writing poetry on the internet because I was trying to express my experiences, and figure out who I was. And so, I think what I’m trying to say is that there will be periods of our life where the need to be seen, heard, understood or we’re figuring out, and forming our identities are a bigger need. And so, the identity expressive element of para-socially expressing or consuming plays a bigger part. And then, perhaps when we’re more settled with our identity, and we’re not really looking to perform that, becomes more of a background thing. Although, it doesn’t completely disappear because we are always looking to be heard, seen, and understood. That’s very human. So, I’ll pause there. I can keep going, but I’ll pause because I see there are a few other hands.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, I’ll give the torch to Dave Millard. But just on that identity, I have a four-and-a-half-year-old boy, Edgar, who is wonderful. And he currently likes sword fighting and the colour pink. He is very feminine, very masculine, very mixed up, as he should be. So, it’s interesting, from a parental, rather than from just an old man’s perspective to think about the shaping of identity, and putting our posters and so on. It’s so easy to think about life from the point we are in life, and you’re pointing to a teenage part, which none of us are in. So, I really appreciate that being brought into the conversation. Mr. Millard?&nbsp;<br><b>David Millard:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, thanks, Frode. Hi, everyone. Sorry, I joined a few minutes late, so I missed the introductions at the beginning. But, yeah. Thank you. It’s a really interesting talk. One of the things we haven’t talked about is kind of the opposite of performative expression, which is privacy. One of the things, a bit like Mark, I’ve kind of learned about myself listening to everyone’s talking about this, is how deeply introverted I am, and how I really don’t want to let anybody know about me, thank you very much, unless I really want them to. This might be because I teach social network and media analytics to our computer scientists. So, one of the things I teach them about is inference, for example, profiling, I’m reminded of the very early Facebook studies done in the 2000s, about the predictive power of keywords. So, you’d express your interests through a series of keywords. And those researchers were able to achieve 90% accuracy on things like sexuality. This is an American study, so republican, democratic preferences. Afro-American, Caucasian, these kinds of things. So I do wonder whether or not there’s a whole element to this, which is subversive or exists in that commercial realm that we ought to think about. I’m also struck about that last comment, actually, that you mentioned, which was about people finding their identities. Because I’ve also been involved in some research looking at how kids use social media. And one of the interesting things about the way that children use social media, including some children that shouldn’t be using social media, because they’re pretty 13 or whatever the cut-off date is. Is that they don’t use it in a very sophisticated way. And we were trying to find out why that was because we all have this impression of children as being naturally able. There’s the myth of the digital native and all that kind of stuff. And it’s precisely because of this identity construction. That was one of the things that came out in our research. So, kids won’t expose themselves to the network, because they’re worried about their self-presentation. They’re much more self-conscious than adults are. So they invest in dyadic relationships. Close friendships, direct messaging, rather than broadcasting identity. So I think there’s an opposite side to this. And it may well be that, for some people, this performative aspect is particularly important. But for other people, this performative aspect is actually quite frightening, or off-putting, or just not very natural. And I just thought I wanted to throw that into the mix. I thought it was an interesting counter observation.&nbsp;<br><b>Jad Esber:&nbsp;</b>Absolutely. Thank you for sharing that. To reflect on my experience growing up writing online. I wrote poetry, not because I wanted other people to read, it was actually very much for myself. And I did it anonymously. I wasn’t looking for any kind of building of credibility or anything like that. It was for me a form of healing. It was for me a form of just figuring out who I was. But if someone did read my poetry, and it did resonate with them, and they did connect with me, then I welcomed that. So, it wasn’t necessarily a performative thing. But it was a way for me to do something for myself that, if it connected with someone else, that was welcomed. I think to go back to the physical metaphor of a bookshelf. Part of my bookshelf will have books that I’ll present, and have upfront and want everyone to see, but I also have a book box with trinkets that are out of sight and are just for me. And that perhaps there are people who will come into my space and I’ll show them what’s in that box, selectively. And I’ll pull them out, and kind of walk them through the trinkets. And then, I’ll have some that are private, and are not for anyone else. So, I totally agree. If we think about digital spaces, if we were to emulate a bookshelf online, there will be elements, perhaps, that I would want to present to the world outwardly. There are elements that are for myself. There are elements that I want to present in a selective manner. And I think back to Frode’s point around bookshelves for various parts of my identity. I think that’s really important. There might be some that I will want to publicly present, and others that I won’t. If you think about a lot of social platforms, how young people use social platforms, think about Instagram. Actually, on Tumblr, which is a great example, the average user had four to five accounts. And that’s because they had accounts that they used for performative reasons. And they had accounts that they used for themselves. And had accounts for specific parts of their identity. And that’s because we’re solving different needs through this idea of para-socially curating and putting out there what we’re interested in. So, just riffing on your point. Not necessarily addressing it, but sort of adding colour to it.&nbsp;<br><b>David Millard:&nbsp;</b>No, that’s great. Thank you. So, you’re right about the multiple accounts thing. I had a student, a few years ago, who’s looking at privacy protection strategies. I’m basically saying, people, don’t necessarily use the preferences on their social media platforms, who can see my stuff. They actually engage differently with those platforms. So they do like that, as you said. They have different platforms, or they have different accounts, for different audiences. They use loads of fascinating stuff, things like social stenography, which is, if they have in-jokes or hidden messages to certain crowds, that they will put in them, their feeds will never miss it. There are all of these really subtle means that people use. I’m sure that all comes into play for this kind of stuff as well.&nbsp;<br><b>Jad Esber:&nbsp;</b>Totally. I’ll add to that really quickly. So, if you look at... I did a study of Twitter bios, and it’s really interesting to look at how, as you said, young folks will put very cryptic acronyms that indicate or signal their fanships. They’re looking for other folks who are interested in the same K-pop band, for example. And that acronym in the bio will be a signal to that audience. Like, come follow me, connect with me around this topic, just because the acronym is in there. A lot of queer folks will also have very subtle things in their bios, on their profile to indicate that. But only other queer folks will be aware of. And so, again, it’s not something you necessarily want to be super public and performative about, but for the right folk, you want them to see and connect with. So, yeah. Super interesting how folks have designed their own way of using these things to solve for very specific needs.&nbsp;<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Just before I let you go, Dave. Did you say steganography or did you say stenography?&nbsp;<br><b>David Millard:&nbsp;</b>I think it’s steganography. It’s normally referred to as hiding data inside other data but in a social context. It was exactly what Jad and I was just saying about using different hashtags or just references, quotes that only&nbsp;certain groups would recognise that kind of stuff, even if they’re from Hamilton.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Brendan, I see you’re ready to pounce here. But just really briefly, one of the things I did for my PhD thesis is, study the history of citations and references. And they’re not that old. And they’re based around this, kind of, let’s call it, “anal notion” we have today that thing should be in the correct box, in the correct order, if it isn’t, it doesn’t belong in the correct academic discipline. Earlier this morning, Dave, Mark, and I were discussing how different disciplines have different ways of even deciding what kind of publication to have. It’s crazy stuff. But before we got into that, we have a profession, therefore, we need a code of how to do it. The way people cited each other, of course, was exactly like this. The more obscure the better, because then you would really know that your readers understood the same space. So it’ s interesting to see how that is sliding along, on a similar parallel line. Brendan, please. Unless Jad has something specific on that point.&nbsp;<br><b>Jad Esber:&nbsp;</b>I was just sourcing a Twitter bio to show you guys. So, maybe, if I find one, I’ll walk through it and show you how various acronyms are indicating various things. And I was just trying to pull it from a paper that I wrote. But, yeah. Sorry, go ahead, Brendan.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Okay, yeah. When you’re ready, please put that in. Brendan?&nbsp;<br><b>Brendan Langen:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;Cool. Jad, really neat to hear you talk through, just really everything around identity as a scene online. It’s a point of a lot of the research I’m doing as well. So, interesting overlaps. First, I’ll kind of make a comment, and then I have a question for you that’s a little off base of what we talked about. But the bookshelf, as a representation, is extremely neat to think about when you have a human in the loop because that’s really where contextual recommendations actually come to life. This idea of an algorithm saying that we’ve read 70% of the same books, and I have not read this one text that you have held really near and dear to you might be helpful but, in all honesty, that’s going to fall short of you being able to share detail on why this might be interesting to me. So I guess to, kind of, pivot into a question, one of my favourite things that I read last year was something you did with, I forget the fella’s name, Scott, around reputation systems and novel approach, and so, I’m studying a little bit in this&nbsp;Web3&nbsp;area, and the idea of splitting reputation, and economic value is really neat. And I’d love to hear you talk a little bit more about ‘Koodos’ and how, either you’re integrating that, or what experiments you’re trying to run in order to bring like curation and reputation into the fold.&nbsp;I guess like, what kind of experiments are you working on with ‘Koodos’ around this reputational aspect?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Jad Esber:</b>&nbsp;Yeah, absolutely. I’m happy to share more. But before I do that, I actually found an example of a Twitter bio, I’ll really quickly share, and then, I’m happy to answer that question, Brendan. So this is from a thing I put together a while ago, and if we look at the username here. So, ‘katie, exclamation mark, seven, four Dune’. So, the seven here actually is supposed to signal to all BTS fans, BTS being a K-pop band that she is part of that group, that fan community. It’s just that simple seven next to her name. Four Dune is basically a way for her to indicate that she is a very big fan of Dune, the movie, and Timothée Chalamet, the actor. And pinned at the top of her Twitter account is this list of the bands or the communities that she stands, stands meaning, being a big fan of. And so, again, sort of like, very cryptically announcing the fan communities she’s a part of just in her name, but also, very actively pinning the rest of the fan communities that she’s a member of, or a part of. But, yeah. I just want to share that really quickly. So, to address, Brendan, your questions, just for folks who aren’t aware of the piece, it’s basically a paper that I wrote about how to decouple reputation from financial gain in system and reputation systems, where there might be a token. So, a lot of&nbsp;Web3&nbsp;projects promise community contributions will earn you money. And the response that myself and Scott Kominers wrote was around, “Hey, it doesn’t actually make sense for intrinsic motivational reasons, for contributions to earn you money. In fact, if you’re trying to build a reputation system, you should develop a system to gain reputation, that perhaps spins off some form of financial gain.{ So, that’s, sort of, the paper. And I can link it in in the chat, as well, for folks who are interested. So, a lot of what I think about with ‘Koodos’, the company that I’m working on, is this idea of, how can people build these digital spaces that represent who they are, and how can that may remain a safe space for identity expression, and perhaps, even solving some of the utilitarian needs. But then, how can we also enable folks, or enable the system, to curate at large, source from across these various spaces that people are building, to surface things that are interesting in ways that aren’t necessarily super algorithmic. And so, a lot of what we think about the experiments we run around how can we enable people to build reputation around what it is that they are curating in their spaces. So, does Mark’s curation of books in his bookshelf give him some level of reputation in specific fields? That then allows us to point to him as a potential expert on that space. Those are a lot of the experiments that we’re interested in running, just sort of, very high level without getting too in the weeds. But I’m happy to discuss, if you’re really interested in the weeds of all of that, without boring everyone, I’m happy to take that conversation as well.&nbsp;<br><b>Brendan Langen:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Yeah. I’ll reach out to you because I’m following the weeds there.&nbsp;<br><b>Jad Esber</b>: Yeah, for sure.&nbsp;<br><b>Brendan Langen</b>: Thanks for the high-level answer.<br><b>Jad Esber</b>: No worries, of course.&nbsp;<br><b>Frode Hegland:</b>&nbsp;Jad, I just wanted to say, after Bob and Fabien now, I would really appreciate it if you go into sales mode, and really pitch what you’re working on. I think, if we honestly say, it’s sales mode, it becomes a lot easier. We all have passions, there’s nothing wrong with being pushy in the right environment, and this is definitely the right environment. Bob?&nbsp;<br><b>Bob Horn:</b>&nbsp;Well, I noticed that your slides are quite visual and that you just mentioned visual. I wonder if, in your poetry life, you’ve thought about broadsheets? And whether you would have broadsheets in the background of coming to a presentation like this, for example, so that you could turn around and point to one and say, “Oh, look at this.”&nbsp;<br><b>Jad Esber:</b>&nbsp;I’m not sure if the question is if I... I’m sorry, what was the question specifically about?&nbsp;<br><b>Bob Horn:</b>&nbsp;Well, I noticed you mentioned that you are a poet, and poets often, at least in times gone by, printed their poems on larger broadsheets that were visual. And I associated that with, maybe, in addition to bookshelves, you might have those on a wall, in some sort of way, and wondered if you’d thought about it, and would do it, and would show us.&nbsp;<br><b>Jad Esber:</b>&nbsp;Yeah. So, the poetry that I used to write growing up was very visual, and it used metaphors of nature to express feelings and emotions. So, it’s visual in that sense. But I am, by no means, a visual artist or not visual in that sense. So, I haven’t explored using or pairing my poetry with visual compliments. Although, that sounds very interesting. So, I haven’t explored that. Most of my poetry is visual in the language that I use. And the visuals that come up in people’s minds. I tend to really love metaphors. Although, I realise that sometimes they can be confining, as well. Because we’re so limited to just that metaphor. And if I were to give you an example of one metaphor, or one word that I really dislike in the&nbsp;Web3&nbsp;world it’s the ‘wallet’. I’m not sure how familiar you are with the metaphor of a wallet in&nbsp;Web3,&nbsp;but it’s very focused on coins and financial things, like what live in your physical wallet, whereas what a lot of wallets are today are containers for identity and not just the financial things you hold. You might say, ‘Well, actually, if you look into my wallet, I have pictures of my kids and my dog or whatever.’ And so, there is some level of storing some social objects that express my identity. I share that just to say that the words we use, and the metaphors that we use, do end up also constraining us because a lot of the projects that are coming out of the space are so focused on the wallet metaphor. So, that was a very roundabout answer to say that I haven’t explored broadsheets, and I don’t have anything visual to share with my poetry right now.&nbsp;<br><b>Bob Horn:</b>&nbsp;What is, just maybe, in a sentence or two, what is Web3?&nbsp;<br><b>Jad Esber:</b>&nbsp;Okay, yeah. Sure. So, Web3, in a very short sense, is what comes after Web2, where Web2 is what we as, sort of, the last phase of the internet that relied on reading and writing content. So if you think about Web1 being read-only, and Web2 being read and write, where we can publish as well. Web3 is read-write and on. So, there is an element of ownership for what we produce on the internet. And so, that’s, in short, what Web3 is. A lot of people associate Web3 with blockchains, because they are the technology that allows us to track ownership. So that’s what Web3 is in a very brief explanation. Brendan, as someone who’s deep in this space, feel free to add as well to that, if I’ve missed anything.&nbsp;<br><b>Bob Horn</b>:&nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Brendan Langen:</b>&nbsp;I guess the one piece that is interesting in the wallet metaphor is that, I guess, the Web2 metaphor for identity sharing was like a profile. And I guess I would love to hear your opinion on comparing those two and the limitations of what even a profile provides as a metaphor. Because there are holes in identity if you’re just a profile.&nbsp;<br><b>Jad Esber:&nbsp;</b>Totally, yeah. Again, what is a profile, right? It’s a very two-dimensional, like... What was a profile before we had Facebook profiles? A profile when you publish something is a little bit of text about you, perhaps it’s a profile picture, just a little bit about you. But what they’ve become is, they are containers for photos that we produce and there are spaces for us to share our interests and we’re creating a bunch of stuff that’s a part of that profile. And so, again, the limiting aspect of the term ‘profile’ exists a lot of on what’s been developed today, again, just hinges on the fact that it’s tied to a username and a profile picture and a little bio. It’s very limiting. I think that’s another really good example. Using the term ‘wallet’ today, again, is limiting us in a similar way to how profiles limited us in Web2. If we were to think about wallets as the new profile. So that’s a really good point I actually hadn’t made that connection, so thank you.<br><b>Fabien Benetou:</b>&nbsp;Thank you. Honestly, I hope there’s going to be, let’s say, a bridge to the pitch. But to be a little bit provocative, honestly, when I hear Web3, I’m not very excited. Because I’ve been burnt before. I checked bitcoin in 2010 or something like this, and Ethereum, and all that. And honestly, I love the promise of the Cypherpunk movement or the ideology behind it. And to be actually decentralised or to challenge the financial system and its abuse speaks to me. I get behind that. But then, when I see the concentration back behind the different blockchains, most of the blockchains are rougher, then I’m like, “Well, we made the dream”. Again, from my understanding of the finance behind all this. And yet, I have tension, because I want to get excited, like I said, the dream&nbsp;should&nbsp;still live. As I was briefly mentioned in the chat earlier, civilians, capitalism, and the difference between doing something in public, and doing something on Facebook, it’s not the same. First, because it’s not in public, it’s not a proper platform. But then, even if you do it publicly on Facebook, is the system to issue value and transform that to money. And I’m very naive, I’m not an economist, but I think people should pay for stuff. It’s easy. I mean, it’s simple, at least. So, if I love your poetry, and I can find a way that can help you, then I pay for it. There is no need for an intermediary, in between, especially if it’s at the cost of privacy and potentially democracy behind. So that’s my tension, I want to find a way. That’s why I’m also about provenance, and how we have a chain of sources, and we can reattribute people back down the line. Again, I love that. But when I hear Web3 I’m like, “Do we need this?” Or can we can, for example, and I don’t like Visa or Mastercard, but I’m wondering if relying on the centralised payment system is still less worse than a&nbsp;Cypherpunk&nbsp;dream that’s been hijacked.&nbsp;<br><b>Brendan Langen</b>:&nbsp; Yeah, I mean, I share your exact perspective. I think Web3 has been tainted by the hyper-financialisation that we’ve seen. And that’s why, when Bob asked what is Web3, it’s just what’s after Web2. I don’t necessarily tie it, from my perspective to crypto necessarily. I think that is a means to that end but isn’t necessarily the only option. There are many other ways that people are exploring, that serve some of the similar outcomes that we want to see. And so, I agree with you. I think right now, the version of Web3 that we’re seeing is horrible, crypto art and buying and selling of NFTs as stock units is definitely not the vision of the internet that we want. And I think it’s a very skeuomorphic early version of it that will fade away and it’s starting to. But I think the vision that a lot of the more enduring projects in the space have around provenance and ownership, do exist. There are projects that exist that are thinking about things in that way. And so, we’re in the very early stages of people looking for a quick buck, because there’s a lot of money to be made in the space, and that will all die out, and the enduring projects will last. And so, I think decoupling&nbsp;Web3&nbsp;from blockchain, like&nbsp;Web3 is&nbsp;what is after&nbsp;Web2,&nbsp;and blockchain is one of the technologies that we can be building on top of, is how I look at it. And stripping away the hyper-financialisation,&nbsp;skeuomorphic&nbsp;approaches that we’re seeing right now from all of that. And then, recognising also, that the term&nbsp;Web3&nbsp;has a lot of weight because it’s used in the space to describe a lot of these really silly projects and scams that we’re seeing today. So, I see why there is tension around the use of that term.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>One of the discussions I had with the upcoming Future of Text work, I’m embarrassed right now, I can’t remember exactly who it was&nbsp;<b>(Dave Croker)</b>, but the point was made that, version numbers aren’t very useful. This was in reference to Visual-Meta, but I think it relates to&nbsp;Web2.&nbsp;Because if the change is small you don’t really need a new version number, and if it’s big enough it’s obvious. So, I think this&nbsp;Web3,&nbsp;I think we all kind of agree here, is basically marketing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Jad Esber:</b>&nbsp;It’s just a term, yeah. I think it’s just a term that people are using to describe the next iteration of the&nbsp;Web.&nbsp;And again, as I said, words have a lot of weight and I’m sure everyone here agrees that words matter. So yeah, I think, when I reference it, usually I’m pointing to this idea of read-write-own. And own being a new entry in the&nbsp;Web.&nbsp;So, yeah.&nbsp;<br><b>Bob Horn:</b>&nbsp;I was wondering whether it was going to refer to the Semantic&nbsp;Web,&nbsp;which Tim Berners-Lee was promoting some years ago. Although, not with a number. But I thought maybe they’ve added a number three to it. But I’m waiting for the Semantic&nbsp;Web,&nbsp;as well.&nbsp;<br><b>Jad Esber:</b>&nbsp;Totally. I think the Semantic&nbsp;Web&nbsp;has inspired a lot of people who are interested in&nbsp;Web3. So, I think there is a returning back to the origins of the internet, right? Ted Nelson’s thinking as well as a big inspiration behind a lot of current thinking in this space. It’s very interesting to see us loop back almost to the original vision of the&nbsp;Web.&nbsp;Yeah, totally.&nbsp;<br><b>Brandel Zachernuk:</b>&nbsp;You talked a little bit about algorithms, and the way that algorithms select. And painted it as ineffable or inaccessible. But the reality of algorithms is that they’re just the policy decisions of a given governing organisation. And based on the data they have, they can make different decisions. They can present and promote different algorithms. And so that ‘Forgotify’&nbsp;is a take on upending the predominant deciding algorithm and giving somebody the ability through some measure of the same data, to make a different set of decisions about what to be recommended. The idea that I didn’t get fully baked, that I was thinking about is the way that a bookshelf is an algorithm itself, as well. It’s a set of decisions or policies about what to put on it. And you can have a bookshelf, which is the result of explicit, concrete decisions like that. You can have a meta bookshelf, which is the set of decisions that put things on it, that causes you to decide it. And just thinking about the way that there is this continuum between the unreachable algorithms that people, like YouTube, like Spotify, put out, and the kinds of algorithms internally that drive what it is that you will put on your bookshelf. I guess what I’m reaching for is some mechanism to bridge those and reconcile the two opposite ends of it. The thing is that YouTube isn’t going to expose that data. They’re not going to expose the hyper parameters that they make use of in order to do those things. Or do you think they could be forced to, in terms of algorithmic transparency, versus personal curation? Do you see things that can be pushed on, in order to come up with a way in which those two things can be understood, not as completely distinct artefacts, but as opposite ends of a spectrum that people can reside within at any other point?&nbsp;<br><b>Jad Esber:</b>&nbsp;Yeah. You touch on an interesting tension. I think there are two things. One is, things being built, being composable, so people can build on top of them, and can audit them. So, I think the YouTube algorithm, being one example of something that really needs to be audited, but also, if you open it, it allows other people to take parts of it and build on top of it. I think that’d be really cool and interesting. But it’s obviously completely orthogonal to YouTube’s business model and building moats. So composability is sort of one thing that would be really interesting. And auditing algorithms is something that’s very discussed in this space. But I think what you’re touching on, which is a little bit deeper, is this idea of algorithms not capturing emotions, and not capturing the softer stuff. And a lot of folks think and talk about an emotional topology for the&nbsp;Web.&nbsp;When we think about our bookshelf, there are memories, perhaps, that are associated with these books, and there are emotions and nostalgia, perhaps, that’s captured in that display of things that we are organising. And that’s not really very easy to capture using an algorithm. And it’s intrinsically human. Machines don’t have emotions, at least not yet. And so, I think that what humans present is context and that’s emotional context, nuance, that isn’t captured by machine curation. And so, that’s why, in the presentation, I talk a little bit about the pairing of the two. It’s important to scale things using programmatic algorithms, but also humans make it real, they add that layer of emotion and context. And there is this parable that basically says that human curation will end up leading to a need for algorithmic curation. Because the more you add and organise, the more there’s a need for then a machine to go in and help make sense of all the things that we’re organising. It’s an interesting pairing, what balance is important, and it’s an open question.&nbsp;<br><b>Frode Hegland:</b>&nbsp;Yeah, Fabien, please. But after that, Brendan, if you could elaborate on what you wrote in the chat regarding this, that would be really interesting. <br><b>Fabien Benetou</b>: It’s to pitch something to potentially consider linking with your platform, it’s an identity management targeting mostly VR, at least at first. And there is completely federated and open source. The thing is it’s very minimalist. It just provides an identity. And you have, let’s say, a 3D model and a name and a list of friends. I think that’s it. But if you were to own things, and you were to be able to either share or display them across the different platforms, I think it could be quite interesting. Because, in the end, we discussed this quite a bit, so I’m going to go back, but there is also a social or showcasing aspect to creation we want to exchange. Honestly, when I do something that I’m proud of, first thing I want to do is to show someone. I’m going to see if my better half is around, she’s not going to get it, but still, I can’t stop myself, I want to show it. I have a friend, they’ll get it, hopefully. I want to show you also here. And so, I want to build, and I want to show it. And I imagine a lot of the creation is, as soon as you find something beautiful, it’s like, “No, I don’t want to keep it to myself. I want to share with my people.” So, I’m wondering at which point that could also help this kind of identity platform or solution, because they were quite abstract in the sense that they’re not specific, let’s say, to one platform, they are on top of that. But then people think, “What for?” Okay, I can log in with, let’s say, Facebook or Apple. I know them. I trust them. So that’s it. I’m just going to click on that button. But it’s always a way for the identity maybe, like again, the discussion we had here is, my identity, me also, what I showcase around me that define me, and I want to not just share it to establish myself as, but also help others discover. So maybe it could be interesting to check how there could be a way to be more than an identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Jad Esber:</b>&nbsp;Totally if you think about DJs, their job is essentially, their profession is essentially to curate music and stitch things together. There are professions that centre around helping other people discover, and that that becomes work, right? So I think helping other people discover can be considered something that gives you back status or gives you back gratification in some form. Perhaps, it just makes you happier. But it also could give you back money and that it’s a profession. Arts curators, DJs. So, there’s a spectrum as well, I think a lot of folks will recommend it because they like it. They will recommend it because gives them some level of status. At the end of the spectrum, it becomes a job. Which I think is certainly an interesting proposition, is like, what does it look like if internet curators are recognised as professionals? Could there be a world where people who are curating high value stuff could be paid? And I think, Brendan alluded to this briefly, beyond just adding links, like the synthesis, the commentary is really valuable, especially with the overload that we have today. And so, I think I alluded to this idea of invisible labor, curation being invisible labor. What if it was recognised? And what if it became a form of paid work? I think that could also be very interesting as an extension to your thought around curating to help others.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><b>Fabien Benetou:</b>&nbsp;So, sorry. I’ll just bounce back because it’s directly related, but I’m just going to throw it out there. If someone wants to tour through WebXR and have some of their favourite spaces and give me a bit of money for doing it, I’m up for attempting that. I know exactly how, but I think it could be quite interesting to have a tour together, and maybe put in our backpack whatever we like, or with whom we connect. And again, across platforms, not just one.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Jad Esber:</b>&nbsp;Totally, yeah. <b>There is precedent to that in a way, like galleries, and museums are institutionalised, like spaces of curated works.</b> We pay to enter them. Is there a way where we can bring that down to the individual, right? A lot of the past version of the Web is taking institutionalised things and making them user-generated. Is there a version of galleries or museums that are user-generated and owned? And that’s an exploration that we’re interested in, as well, at ‘Koodos’. So, something we’re exploring.<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Fabien, I saw you put a link here to <a href="https://youtu.be/i_dZmp59wGk?t=6211">web.immers.space</a>. Reminds me to mention to you guys that someone from ‘Immersed’, the company that makes the virtual screens in Oculus will be doing a hosted meeting soon. On a completely different tangent from what this is about, but I just wanted to mention to you guys.&nbsp;Brendan, would you mind going further about what you’re talking about?<br><b>Brendan Langen:&nbsp;</b>Sure. I think it’s minimal, but the act of curation, I suppose, I should have qualified the type of research that I’m talking about. My background is in UX research. So, when you’re digging into any one of our experiences with a tool, and we run into a pinpoint, or we stop using, we leave the page. The data can tell us, we were here when this happened. But it takes so much inference to figure out what it actually was that caused it. Could be that we just got a phone call, and it was not a spam call for once, and we’re thinking, “Oh, wow. I have to pick this up and talk to my mother.” Or it could be that this is so frustrating, and as I kept clicking, and clicking, I just got overwhelmed, and I didn’t want to deal with it anymore. And everything between there. And that’s really where the role of user research comes in. And that was the comparison to curation, is that, we can only understand what feeling someone had, when they heard that song that changed their life, or read a passage that triggered a thought that they then wrote an essay out. And it’s something that I have to dive into further, and further. It’s like, the human is needed in the loop at all times. Mark and I have talked a lot about this. It does not matter how your data comes back to you, regardless, you’re gonna need to clean it. And you’re going to need to probe into it, and enrich it with a human actually asking questions.<br><b>Jad Esber:&nbsp;</b>Totally, yeah. That resonates very deeply. And I can share a little bit about ‘Koodos’, because I’ve alluded to it, but I will also share that it’s very early, and very experimental. So that’s why there isn’t really that much to share. But I think it centres around that exact idea of, how can we bottle or memorialise the feeling that we have around discovering that thing that resonated. And the experience, right now, centres on this idea of, “Hey. When I’m listening to this song, or I’m reading this article, or watching this video, and it resonates. What can I do with it to memorialise it, and to keep it, and to kind of create something based on it?” And so, right now, people create these cards that sort of link out to content that they love from across the Web. And on those cards, they can add context or commentary. And a lot of what people are adding tends to be emotional. The earliest experiment centred on people adding emojis, just emoji tags to the content to summarise the vibe of the content. And these cards are all time-stamped, so there’s also a way for you to see when someone came across something. And they’re all added to a library, or an archive, or a bedroom, or bookshelf, whatever you’re going to call it, that aggregates all the cards that you’ve created. So it becomes a way for you to explore what people are interested in. What they’re saying and feeling about the things that they come across that resonates. The last thing I’ll share, as well, is that these cards unlock experiences. So, if I created a card for Brendan’s paper, for example, I’ll get access to a collection, where other people have created cards for Brendan’s work live, and I can see all of what they commentated and created, and who they are, and maybe go into their libraries and see what it is that they are creating cards for. So, that’s the current experience. And again, in the early stages. Most of our users are quite young, that’s why I sort of speak a lot about identity formative years, when you’re constructing your identity being a really important phase in life. And so, our users are around that age. And that’s what we’re doing and we’re thinking about. And just provide some context for a lot of the perspectives that I share.<br><b>Brendan Langen:&nbsp;</b>I have to comment. I love the idea of prompting reflection. Especially at a stage where you are identity-forming. There’s nothing like cultivating your taste by actually talking about what you liked and disliked about something. And then, being able to evoke that in the frame of, how it made me feel in a moment, can build up a huge library of personal understanding. So, that’s rather neat. I need to check this out a little further.<br><b>Jad Esber:&nbsp;</b>Totally, yeah. We can chat further. I think the one big thought that has come about, from the early experimentation is that, people use it as a form for mental health reasons. Prompting you to reflect, or capture emotion over time, and archiving what has resonated, and what you felt over time is a really healthy thing to do. So that was an interesting outcome of the early product.<br><br><h3 id="33F21E86-7C24-4E34-8CC3-FEBB61F46A5A">Closing Comments</h3><br><br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>There are&nbsp;so many opportunities with multiple dimensions of where this knowledge can go. We also have, upcoming, Phil Gooch from Scholarcy, who will be doing a presentation. He doesn’t do anything with VR, AR or anything. But what he does do is, <a href="https://youtu.be/i_dZmp59wGk?t=6526">scholarcy.com</a> analyses documents, academic documents. So they do all kinds of stuff that seems to be on more of the logical side, where it seems, Jad, you’re more of the emotional side. And I can imagine, specifically for this community, the insane amount of opportunities for human interactions in these environments. And then how we’re going to do the plumbing to make sure it is vulnerable. You said earlier, when defining&nbsp;Web3.0, one of the terms is ownable. The work we’ve been doing with Visual-Meta is very much about, we need to be able to own our own data. So, it was nice to hear that in that context. We’re winding down. It’s really nice to have two hours, so it’s not so rushed. So we can actually listen to each other. Are there any closing comments, questions, suggestions, or hip-hop improvisations?<br><b>Fabien Benetou:&nbsp;</b>I’m not going to do any hip-hop improvisation, not today at least. Quick comment, though is, I wouldn’t use such a platform. And also, I would say, without actually owning it, meaning for example, at least a way to export data, and have it in a meaningful way And I don’t pour my life into things, because especially here, is the emotional aspect without some safety, literal safety of being able to extract it, and ideally live, because I’m a programmer. So, if I can tinker with the data itself, that also makes it more exciting for me. But I do hope there is some way to easily, conveniently do that and hopefully, there is a need to consider leaving the platform. Tinkering I think it’s always worthwhile. No need to leave, but it’s still being able to actually have it do whatever you want. I think is pretty precious.<br><b>Jad Esber:&nbsp;</b>Yes, thank you. Thank you for sharing that, Fabien. And absolutely. That’s a very important consideration. So, the cards you create are tied to you, not to the space that you occupy or you create on ‘Koodos’. That’s a really key part of the architecture. And I hear you on the privacy and safety aspect. Again, this is a complex human system and so, when designing them, beyond the software you’re building, I think the social design is really important. And aspects of what is in the box, that’s for yourself. The trinkets that you keep to yourself, versus the cards that are the books that you present to the rest of the folks that come into your space. I think is an important design question. So, yeah. Thank you for sharing, Fabien.<br><b>Fabien Benetou:&nbsp;</b>A quick little thing, that is a lot more open, let’s say, unfortunately, I can’t remember the name, but three or four years ago, there was a viewer experience done by Lucas something, maybe somebody will remember, where you had like a dozen or two dozens of clouds on top of your head, couple of scenes, and you could pull a cloud, in order to listen to someone else’s voice. And each space, virtual space was a prompt to, when is the last time you cried? Yes, <a href="https://youtu.be/i_dZmp59wGk?t=4340">www.lucasrizzotto.com</a>. And so, his experience must be there in his portfolio, is three or four years old. But maybe half a dozen different spaces, with different ambiance, different visuals, and sounds. And every time prompting, well, I don’t know, what’s the meaning of life, simple, easy questions. And then, if you want to talk, you can talk and share it back with the community. And if you don’t want to talk. you don’t have to. So, it’s not what you do, but I think there are some connections, some things could be inspiring, also, to check it out.<br><b>Jad Esber:&nbsp;</b>I guess, on my part, I just want to say thank you for the conversation, and for being here for the two hours. It’s a long time to talk about this stuff. But I appreciate it. And yeah, I look forward to, hopefully, joining future sessions, as well. Sounds like a really interesting string of conversations. And it’s great to connect with you all virtually and to hear your questions and perspectives. Yeah, thank you.<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Yeah. It’s very nice to have you here. And the thing about the group is, okay, we are today, except for Dene, we’re all male and so on. But we do represent quite a wide variety of mentalities. And this is something we need to increase as much as we can. It is crucial. And also, I really appreciate you bringing in, literally, a new dimension dealing with emotions and identities into the discussion. So, it’s going to be very interesting moving forward. I was not interested in VR, AR at all in December. And then, Brandel came into my life. And now it is all about, I’m actually decided I can use the word metaverse because Meta doesn’t own it, I’ve decided to settle down. But the point is, I feel we’re already living in the metaverse. We’re just not seeing it through as many rich means as we can. And I don’t want to go into the metaverse with only social and gaming. And today, thank you for highlighting that we need to have our identities managed in this environment, and taken with us. So, I’m very grateful. And I look forward to seeing those of you who can on Friday. And we’re going to be doing, as I said, every two weeks presentations in this format. <br><b>Fabien Benetou:&nbsp;</b>I have a quote for this. It’s on my desktop, actually. It’s, <b>“When technology shifts reality, will we know the world has changed?” </b>it’s from Ken Perlin that we mentioned last time. I’ll put it in the chat.<br><h1 id="5E19B6AD-A640-407B-ACC8-01B50FEC6DBC">Gavin Menichini</h1><br><br><center><h2 id="9C25624D-1CA9-4852-A819-E255FF186811">Journal Guest Product Presentation : 25 February 2022</h2><br></center><br><a href="https://youtu.be/2Nc5COrVw24?t=1353">https://youtu.be/2Nc5COrVw24?t=1353</a>â€¨<br><b>Gavin Menichini:&nbsp;</b> Immersed is a virtual reality product, working productivity software, where we make virtual offices. And so, what that means is, Immersed is broken down into two categories, in my opinion. We have a solo use case, and we have a collaboration meeting use case. So, the main feature that we have in Immersed is the ability to bring your computer screen, whether you have a Mac, a PC, or Linux, into virtual reality. So, whatever is on your computer screen is now brought to Immersed. And we’ve created our own proprietary technology to virtualize extensions of your screen. Very similar to, if you had a laptop or computer at your desk, and you plugged in extra, physical monitors, from our screen real estate. We’ve now virtualized that technology. It’s proprietary to us. And we’re the only ones in the world who can do that. And then, now at Immersed, instead of you working on one screen, for example, I use the MacBook Pro for work, so instead of me working on one MacBook Pro, with an Oculus Quest 2 headset, or a compatible headset, I can connect it to my computer, have a Immersed software on my computer, in my headset, bring my screen into virtual reality, have the ability to maximize it to the size of an iMac screen. I can shrink it and then create up to five virtual monitors around me for a much more immersive work experience for your 2D screens. And you can also have your own customized avatar that looks like you, and you can beam into all these cool environments that we’ve created. Think of them as higher fidelity, higher quality video game atmospheres. But not like a game, more like a professional environment. But we also have some fun gaming environments, or space station offices, or a space orbitarium, auditorium. We have something called alpine chalet, like a really beautiful ski lodge. Really, the creativity is endless. And so, within all of our environments, you can work there, and you can also meet and collaborate with people as other avatars, instead of us meeting here on zoom, where we’re having a 2D, very disconnected experience. I’m sure each of you probably heard the term Zoom fatigue or video conference fatigue? That’s been very real, especially with the COVID pandemic. And so, fortunately, that’s hopefully going away, and we can have a little bit more in-office interactions. But we believe Immersed is the perfect solution for hybrid and remote working. It’s the best tech bridge for recreating that sense of connection with people. And that sense of connection has been very valuable for a lot of organizations that we’re working with, as well as enhancing the collaboration experience from our monitor tech, and our screen sharing, screen streaming technology. So, people use it for the value, and the value that people get out of it is that, people find themselves more productive when working in Immersed, because now, they want to have more screen real estate, like all the environment we’ve been potentially created, to help preach cognitive focus. So, I have lots of news for customers and users who tell us that when they’re Immersed. They feel hyper-focused. More productive. In a state of deep workflow, whatever term you want to use. And people are progressing through the work faster, and feel less distracted. And then, just also, generally more connected, because when you’re in VR, it really feels like you have a sense of presence when you’re sitting across from a table from another avatar that is your friend or colleague. And that really boosts employee and person satisfaction, connection, just for an overall engaging, better collaborative experience when working remotely. Any questions around what I explained, or what Immersed is?â€¨<br><b>Dialogue</b><br><a href="https://youtu.be/2Nc5COrVw24?t=1549">https://youtu.be/2Nc5COrVw24?t=1549</a>&nbsp;<br><br><b>Fabien Benetou:&nbsp;</b>Super lovely. When you say screen sharing, for example, here I’m using Linux. Is it compatible with Linux? Or is it just Windows or macOS? Is it web-based?<br><b>Gavin Menichini:&nbsp;</b>So, it is compatible with Linux. And so, right now, you can have virtual monitors through a special extension that we’ve created. We’re still working on developing the virtual display tech to the degree we have for Mac and Windows. Statistics says that Linux is only one of two percent of our user base. And so, for us, as a business, we obviously have to optimize for most of our users. Since we’re a venture-backed startup. But that’s coming in the future. And then, you can also share screens with Linux. And so, with some of the extensions, you can use it for having multiple Linux displays, you can share those screens, as well, within Immersed.â€¨<b>Video:&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/2Nc5COrVw24?t=1594">https://youtu.be/2Nc5COrVw24?t=1594</a></b><br><b>Alan Laidlaw:&nbsp;</b>That’s great. Yeah, this is really impressive. This is a question that may be more of a theme to get into later. But I definitely see the philosophy of starting with, where work is happening now, and like the way that you make train tracks, bringing bits and pieces into VR so that you can get bodies in there. I’m curious as to, once that’s happened or once you feel like you’ve got that sufficiently covered, is there a next step? What would you want the collaborative space in VR to look like that is unlike anything that we have in the real world, versus... Yeah, I’d love to know where you stand philosophically on that, as well, as whatever the roadmap is?<br><b>Gavin Menichini:&nbsp;</b>Sure. If I’m understanding your question properly, it’s how do we feel about how we see the evolution of VR collaboration, versus in-person collaboration? If we see there’s going to be an inherent benefit to VR collaboration as we progress, versus in person?<br><b>Alan Laidlaw:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, there’s that part. And there’s also, the kind of, is the main focus of the company to replicate and provide the affordances that we currently have, but in VR? Or is the main focus, now that you know once we’ve ported things into a VR space, let’s explore what VR can do?<br><b>Gavin Menichini:&nbsp;</b>Okay. So, it’s a little bit of both. It’s mostly just, we want to take what’s possible for in-person collaboration and bring it into VR, because we see a future of hybrid remote working. And so, COVID, obviously, accelerated this dynamic. So, Renji, our founder, started the company in 2017, knowing, believing that hybrid remote work was gonna become more and more possible as the internet and all things Web 2.0 became more prevalent. And we have technology tools where you don’t have to drive into an office every single day to accomplish work and be productive. But we found that the major challenges were, people aren’t as connected. The collaboration experience isn’t the same as being in person. So those are huge challenges for companies, in a sense of a decrease in productivity. So, all these are major challenges to solve. And those are the challenges that Renji set out to go build and fix with Immersed. So when we think about the future, we see Immersed as the best tech bridge, or tool for hybrid or remote working. Where you can maximize that sense of connection that you have in person, by having customizable avatars, where fidelity and quality will increase over time, giving you the tech tools through multiple monitors and solo work. Enhancing the solo work experience. So people become more productive, which is the end goal of giving them more time back in the day. And then also, corporations can continue to progress, as well, in their business goals, while balancing that with giving employees more time back of their day to find that beautiful balance. And so, we see it as a tech bridge, but we, as a VR company, we’re also are exploring the potentials of VR. Is there something that we haven’t tapped into yet that could be extremely valuable for all of our customers and users to add more value to their life and make their life better? So, it’s less so that, it’s more so we want to virtualize, make the hybrid remote collaboration, work experience, much more full, better value, with more value than it currently exists today with the Zoom, Slack, Microsoft Teams paradigm.&nbsp;<br><b>Brandel Zachernuk:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, I’m curious. It sounds like, primarily, or entirely, what you’ve built is the the connective tissue between the traditional 2D APPs that people are using within their computer space, and being able to create multi-panels, that people are interacting with that content on. Is that primarily through traditional input? Mouse, keyboard, trackpad? Or is this something where they’re interacting with those 2D APPs through some of the more spatial modalities that are offered hands or controllers? Do you use hands or is it all entirely controller-based?<br><b>Gavin Menichini:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, great question. So, the answer is, our largest user base is on the Oculus Quest 2. It’s definitely the strongest headset, bang for your buck on the market for now. There’s no question. But, right now, you can control your VR dynamics with the controllers or with hand tracking. We actually suggest people use hand tracking, because it’s easier, once you get used to it. One of the challenges we face right now is, there is an inherent learning curve for people learning how to interact with VR paradigms. And, as me being on a revenue side, I have to demonstrate Immersed to a lot of different companies and organizations, and so it can be challenging. At some point, I imagine it would be very similar. And I was born in 95, and so I wasn’t around these times. But I imagine it feels like demoing email to someone for the first time, on a computer, and they’ve never seen a computer, where they totally understand the concept of email. No more paper memos, no more post-it notes. Paper organization and file cabinets, all exist in the computer, and they get it. But, when I put a computer in front of them for the first time, they don’t know how to use it. What’s this track? They had the keyboard, the mouse, they don’t understand the UI, UX of the Oculus, the OS system. They don’t understand how to use that, so it’s intimidating. So, that’s the challenge we come across. And then, that answers your point with your first question, Brandel?<br><b>Brandel Zachernuk:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, I’ve got some follow-ups, but I’ll cede the floor to Frode.<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Okay. I’m kind of on that point. So, I have been using Immersed for a bit. And the negatives, to take that first, is that I think the onboarding really needs help. It’s nice when you get that person standing to your side and pointing out things, but then... So, the way it works is, the hand tracking is really good. That is what I use. I use my normal keyboard, physical keyboard on my Mac, and then I have the monitor. But it’s, to me, a little too easy to go in and out of the mode where my hands change the position and size of the monitor. You’re supposed to do a special hand thing to lock your hands to not be doing that. And so there’s pinning. So, when you’re talking about these onboarding issues, that’s still a lot of work. And that’s not a complaint about your company. That’s a complaint across the board. The surprise is also, it really is very pleasant. I mean, here, in this group, we talk about you know many kinds of interactions, but what I would like, in addition to making it more locked, to make the pinning easier. I do find that, sometimes, it doesn’t want to go exactly where I want. I’m a very visual person, kind of anal in that way, to use that language. I want it straight ahead of me, but very often it’s a little off. So, if I resize it this way, then it kind of follows. So, in other words, I’m so glad that you are working on these actual realities, boots on the ground thing, rather than just hypotheticals. Because it shows how difficult it is. You get this little control thing on your wrist, if there was one that says “hyper control mode”, different levels. Anyway, just observation, and question, and point.<br><b>Gavin Menichini:&nbsp;</b>Yeah. I can assure you that we obsess over these things internally. Our developers are extremely passionate about what we’re building. We have a very strong XR team. And our founder is very proud about how hard it is to get to our company, and how many people we reject. So, we really are hiring the best talent in the world, and I’ve seen this first-hand, getting to work with them. And we also have a very strong UI, UX team. But we’re really on the frontier of, this has never been done before. And we are pioneering. What does it mean to have excellent UI, UX paradigms and user onboarding paradigms in virtual reality? And one of the challenges we face is that, it’s still early. And so people are still trying to figure out, even foundations for what is good UI, UX. And we’re now introducing space, like spatial computing. And we’re going from 2D interfaces to 3D. What have we learned from good UI, UX or 2D translate to 3D, and paradigms of this? And people are now not just using a controller and mouse, they’re using hand tracking and spatial awareness. And how do we build good, not only do we understand what’s a good practice for having good paradigms in UI, UX, how do we code that well? And how do we build a good product around that, while also having dependencies on Oculus, HTC, and Apple? Where we’re dependent upon hardware technology to support our software. So we still live very much in the early days, where there’s a lot of tension of things are still being figured out. Which is why we’re a frontier tech. Which is why it takes time to build. But even with VR, AR, I think, it’s just going to take longer because there are so many more factors to consider. The people who pioneered 2D technology, Apple, Microsoft, etc, they didn’t have to consider. And so, I think the problem we’re solving candidly is exponentially harder than the problem they had to solve. But we also get to stand on their shoulders, and take some precedence that they built for us, and apply that to VR, where it makes sense.â€¨<b>Brandel Zachernuk:&nbsp;</b>So, in terms of those new modalities. In terms of the interaction paradigms that seem to make the most sense, it sounds like you’re not building software that people use, as much as you’re using making software that people reach through to their other software with, at this point. Is that correct? You’re not making a word processor, you’re making the app that lets people see that word process. Which is a big problem. I’m not minimizing it. My question is:<br>Do you have observations based on what people are using the way that they’re changing, for example, the size of their windows, the kinds of ways that they’re interacting with it? Do you have either observations about what customers are doing as a result of making the transition into effective productivity there? Or do you have any specific recommendations about things that they should avoid or reconsider given the differences in, for example, pixel density, or the angular fidelity of hand tracking within 3D, in comparison to the fidelity of being able to move around a physical mouse and keyboard? Given that those things are so much more precise. But also, much more limited in terms of the real estate that they have the ability to cover. Do you have any observations about what people do? Or even better, any recommendations that you make to clients about what they should be doing as a result of moving into the new medium?<br><b>Gavin Menichini:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, really good question. There are a few things. There’s a lot of things we could suggest. So, a lot of what we’re building is still very exploratory, of what’s the best paradigm for these things? And so, we’ve learned a lot of things, but we also understand there’s a lot more for us to build internally and explore. First and foremost, we definitely do not take, hopefully, this is obvious, but to address it, we definitely do not take a dystopian view of VR, AR. We don’t want people living in the headset. We don’t want people strapped it to their face extremities, like a feeding tube and water, etc. That’s not the future we want. We actually see VR, AR as a productivity enhancer, so people can spend less time working, because they’re getting more done in our products, because we’ve created a product so good that allows them to be more productive, so they get more done at work, but also, have more time to themselves. So, we suggest people take breaks, we don’t want you in a headset for eight hours straight. The same way no person would suggest for you to sit in front of your computer, and not stand, use the restroom, eat lunch, go on a walk or take a break. We could take the same paradigms. Because you can get so focused on Immersed, we also encourage our users to like, “Yeah, get stuff done, but take a break”. But then we’re also thinking through some of the observations we found. We’ve been surprised at how focused people have been. And the onboarding challenge is a big challenge, as Frode was mentioning. It’s one that we think about often. How do we make the onboarding experience better? And we’ve made progressions based on where we came from in the past. So, Frode, you’re seeing some of the first iterations of our onboarding experience, in the past, we didn’t have one. There’s something we actually pushed really hard for. We saw a lot of challenges of users sticking around because we didn’t have one. And we’re now continuing to push how do we make this easier. Explain things to people without making it too long, where people get uninterested and leave. It’s a really hard problem to solve. But we found, as we’re having an easier onboarding experience, helping people get used to the paradigms of working in VR and AR, and explaining how our technology works, and letting them get to, what we like to call this magic moment, of where they can see the potential of seeing and having their screens in VR. Having it be fully manipulative, you’re like the Jedi in the force. You can push and pull your screens with hand tracking, to pinch and expand. Put them all around you. If I’m answering your question, Brandel, we’re still exploring a lot of paradigms. But we found that it’s surprising how focused people are getting, which is awesome and encouraging. We find, which isn’t surprising as much anymore, companies, organizations, and teams are always very wild at how connected they feel to each other. So we always try to encourage people to work together. So, even on our elite tier, which is just our middle tier, like a pro think of it as a pro solo user, you have the ability to collaborate with up to four people in a private room. But we also have public spaces, where people can hang out and it’s free to use. Just think of it as a virtual coffee shop. You can hang out there, and meet with people. You can’t share your screens, obviously, for security reasons. But you can meet new people and collaborate. And it’s been cool to see how we’ve informed our own community where people can be connected with each other to be able to hang out and meet new people. So, hopefully, that answers a little bit of your question. There’s still a lot more we’re learning about the paradigms of working in 2D screens, and what people prefer, what’s the best practice.<br><b>Brandel Zachernuk:&nbsp;</b>Yeah. One of the issues that I face when I think about where people can expect to be in VR productivity at this point, is the fact that Quest 1, Quest 2 and Vive, all of these things have a focal distance. Which is pretty distant, normally a minimum accommodation distance is about 1.4 meters, which means that anything that’s at approximately arm’s length. Which is where we have done the entirety of our productivity in the past. Is actually getting to within eye strain territory. The only headset that is out on the market that has any capacity for addressing that kind of range is actually the Magic Leap. Which I don’t recommend anybody pursue, because it’s got a second focal plane at 35 centimetres. Do you know where people put those panels on Quest? On Vive? I don’t know if you’ve got folks in a crystal or a coral value, whether that has any distinction in terms of where they put them? Or alternatively, do you recommend or are you aware of anybody making any modifications for being able to deal with a closer focal distance? I’m really interested in whether people can actually work the way they want to, as a consequence of the current limitations of the hardware at the moment.<br><b>Gavin Menichini:&nbsp;</b>Yeah. There are a few things in response to that. One: We’ve actually found, internally, even with the Quest 2, although the screen distance, et cetera, focal point, is a challenge, we’ve actually found that people in our experience are reporting less eye strain working in VR, than they are working from their computer. We’re candidly still trying to figure out why that’s the case. I’m not sure how the distance and the optics games that they’re playing in the Quest 2 and other headsets we use. But we’ve actually found that people are reporting less eye strain, just solely on customer reviews and feedback. So we haven’t done any studies. I personally don’t know a lot around IPDs and focal length distance of the exact hardware technology of all the headsets on the market. All I’m doing is paying attention to our customers, what they’re saying, and our users. And we’re actually, surprisingly, not getting that much eyestrain. We’ve actually said that a lot of people say they prefer working in VR than from their computers, without even blue light glasses. And they’re still getting less eye strain. So, the science and technicalities of how it’s working, I’m not sure. It’s definitely out of my realm of expertise. But I can assure you that the hardware manufacturers, because of our close relationship with Meta, HTC, they’re constantly thinking about that problem too, because you’re strapping an HMD to your face, how do you have a good experience from a health standpoint for your eyes?<br><b>Brandel Zachernuk:&nbsp;</b>Do you know how much time people are clocking in it?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Gavin Menichini:&nbsp;</b>On average, our first user session is right around an hour 45 minutes to two hours. And we have power users who are spending six to eight hours a day inside of Immersed, clocking that much time in and generating getting value out of it. And it’s consistent. And I’m not sure what our average session time is. I would say it’s probably around an hour, two hours. But we have people who use it for focus first, where they want to go and focus sessions on Immersed, or people will spend four or five hours in it, and our power users will spend six, seven, eight hours.â€¨<b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>I can address these few points. Because, first of all, it’s kind of nice. I don’t go on Immersed every week, but when I do, I do get an email that says how many minutes I spent in Immersed, which is quite a useful statistic. So, I’m sure, obviously, you guys have more on that. When it comes to the eye strain, I tend to make the monitor quite large and put it away to do exactly the examination you’re talking about, Brandel. And I used to not like physical monitors being at that distance. It was a bit odd. But since I am keyboard, trackpad, where I don’t have to search for a mouse, I don’t need to see my hands anyway, even though I can. I do think that works. But maybe, Gavin, would you want to, you said you had a video to share a little bit of what it looks like?<br><b>Gavin Menichini:&nbsp;</b>Sure, yeah. I can pull that up real quick. So it’s a quick marketing demo video, but it does do a good job of showcasing the potential of what’s possible. And I’m not sure if you guys will be able to hear the audio. It’s just fun background music. It’s not that important. The visuals are what’s more important. Let me go ahead and pull this up for us real quick.<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>I think you can just mute the audio and then talk if you want to highlight something, I guess.<br><b>Gavin Menichini:&nbsp;</b>Okay. Actually, yeah. That’s probably a good idea. So, this is also on YouTube. So just for each of your points, if you guys are curious and want to see more content, just type in&nbsp;Immersed VR&nbsp;on YouTube. Our Immersed logo is pretty clear. Our content team and marketing team put out a lot of content, so if you’re curious. We also have a video called “Work in VR, 11 tips for productivity”, where a head of content goes through some different pro tips. If you’re curious and just want to dive in more of a more nuanced demo of how you do things, etc, to see more of the user experience. So, this is a good, helpful high level video. So you can see you can have full control of your monitor. You can make it ginormous, like a movie screen. We have video editors, day traders, finance teams, and mostly developers are our main customer base. As you can see here, the user just sitting down at the coffee table, the keyboard is tracked. We also have a brand new keyboard feature coming out, it’s called keyboard passthrough, where we’ll leverage the cameras of your Oculus Quest to hold the VR and see your real-life keyboard, which we’re very excited about. And here you can just see just a brief collaboration session of two users collaborating with each other side by side. You can also incorporate your phone into VR, if you want to have your phone there. And then, here you’ll see what it looks like to have a meeting in one of our conference rooms. So, you can have multiple people in the room, we usually had 30 plus people in an environment, so it can easily support that. It also depends on, obviously, everyone’s network strength and quality, very similar to Zoom, or phone call. And that shows how quality the meeting is from their audio and screen sharing input, but if everyone’s on a good network quality, that’s not an issue. And then, lastly here, you can see one of our users with five screens, working in a space station. And that’s about it. Any questions or things that stood out from that, specifically?<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Yeah. A question about the backgrounds. You have some nice environments that can be applied. I think we can also import any 360° images, is that right, currently? And if so, can we also load custom 3D environments in the future? Are you thinking about customization for that aspect of it?<br><b>Gavin Menichini:&nbsp;</b>Yes. So, we are thinking about it, and we do have plans for users to incorporate 3D environments. There are a few challenges with that, for a few obvious reasons, which I could touch on a second. But we do support 360° environments, 360° photos for users to incorporate. And we also have a very talented artist and developer team that are constantly making new environments. And we have user polls, and we figure out what our users want to build and what they’d like to see. And as we, obviously, continue to grow our company, right now we’re in the process of fundraising for a series, and once we do that, we’re hoping to go from 27-28 employees right now, to at least 100 by the end of the year. The vast majority of them will be developers to continue to enhance the quality of our product. And then, we also will support 3D imports of environments. But because the Quest 2 has some compute limitations, we have to make sure that each of our environments have specific poly counts, and specific compute measurements, so that the Quest 2 won’t explode if they try and open that environment in Immersed, as well as making sure that your Immersed experiences can be optimized in high quality and not going to lag, et cetera. So right now, we’re thinking: How do we enable our users to build custom environments? And then, two: How do we make sure they meet our specific requirements for the Quest 2. But naturally, over time, headsets are getting stronger, computing powers are getting better. Very similarly when you go from a Nintendo 64 graphics, to now the Xbox Series X. The ginormous quality. Headset quality will be the same. So, we’ll have more robust environments to have some more, give and take optimizations for environments our users give to us. So it isn’t our pipeline, but we’re pushing it further down the pipeline than we originally wanted. Just doe to some natural tech limitations. And also the fact that we are an adventure back startup, and we have to be extremely careful of what we work on, and optimize for the highest impact. But we’re starting to have some more fun and having some traction in our series A conversations. And hopefully have some more flexibility, financially, to continue pushing.<br><b>Alan Laidlaw:&nbsp;</b>Yes. So, this is maybe a, kind of, Twilio-esque question about the design material of network strength bandwidth and compute, like you mentioned. And I’m wondering, I saw in the demo, the virtual keyboard that, of course, the inputs would be connected to a network versus a physical keyboard that you already have in front of you, if it were possible to use the physical keyboard and have those inputs go into the VR environment, or AR environment, in this case, would that be preferred? Is that the plan? And if so, you know, that opens up, I mean, this is such a rich pioneer, as you mentioned, territory, so many ways to handle this. Would there be a future where, if my hands are doing one thing, then that’s an indication that I’m in my real world environment, but if I hand at something else and that’s suggesting, you know, take my hand into VR, so I can manipulate something? I’m curious about. Any thoughts about, essentially, that design problem, versus the hard physical constraints of bandwidth? Is it just easier? Does it make a better experience to stick with a virtual keyboard for that reason? So, you don’t, at least, have a disconnect between real world and VR? And I’m sure there are other ways to frame that question.<br><b>Gavin Menichini:&nbsp;</b>No, that’s fine. And I can answer a few points and a few follow up questions to make sure I understand you correctly. For the keyboard, specifically, the current keyboard tracking system we have in place is not optimal. It was just the first step of what we wanted to build to help make the typing VR problem easier, which is our biggest request. So we are now leveraging, I think, a way stronger feature, which is called “Keyboard pass-through”. So, for those who you know, the Oculus Quest 2 has a pass-through feature, where you can see the real world around you through the camera system, and they’re stitching the imagery together. We now have the ability to create a pass-through portal system, where you can cut out a hole in VR over your keyboard. So, whatever keyboard you have, whether it’s Mac, Apple, whatever. The funky keyboards, that a lot of our developers really like to use for a few reasons, you can now see that keyboard in your real hands through a little cut-out in VR. And then, when it comes from inputs, of what you mentioned of doing something with your hands, it being a real life thing versus VR thing. Are you referring to that in regards to having a mixed reality headset where it can do AR and VR and you want to be able to switch from real world to VR with the hand motion?<br><b>Alan Laidlaw:&nbsp;</b>Yeah. A piece of my question. I can clarify. I am referring to mixed. But specifically where that applies is the cut-out window approach, is definitely a step in the right direction. But it seems that’s still based entirely on the Oculus understanding of what your fingertips are doing. Which will obviously have some misfires. And that would be an incredibly frustrating experience for someone who’s used to a keyboard always responding, hitting the keys that you’re supposed to be hitting. So, at some point, it might make more sense to say, “Okay, actually we’re going to cut out. We’re going to forget the window approach and have the real input from the real keyboard go into our system”.&nbsp;<br><b>Gavin Menichini:&nbsp;</b>So, that’s what it is, Alan. Just to further clarify, we always want our users to use their real hands on the real keyboard. And you’re not using your virtual hands on a virtual keyboard. You’re now seeing, with pass-through, your real hands and your real keyboard, and you’re typing on your real keyboard.<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>A really important point to make in this discussion is, if for a single user, there are two elements here: There is the thing around you image of 3D, and then you have your screen. But that is the normal Mac, Linux or Windows screen. And you use your normal keyboard. So, I have, actually, used my own software. I’ve used Author to do some writing on a big nice screen, so it is exactly the keyboard I’m used to.<br><b>Alan Laidlaw:&nbsp;</b>Right. So, how that applies to the mixed reality question is, if I’m using the real keyboard, have the real screen, but one of my screens is an iPad, a touch screen, that’s in VR, where I want to move some elements around, how do I then, transition from my hands in the real world to now I want my hand to be in VR?<br><b>Gavin Menichini:&nbsp;</b>So, you’re going to be in Immersed, as of now. You’re going to be in VR, and you’re going to have a small cut out into the real world. And so, it’s just, right here is a real world, through a cutout hole, and then, if you have your hands here, and you want to move your hands into here, the moment your hands leave the pass-through portal in VR, it turns into virtual hands. And so, to further clarify, right now, your virtual hands, you have in hand tracking, will still be over your hands on the pass-through window. We’re experimenting taking that out for further clarity of seeing your camera hands on your keyboard. But, yes. When you’re in Immersed, it’ll transition from your camera hands, real life hands, to virtual hands. If you have an iPad and you want to swipe something, whatever, it’s that’s seamless. But then, for mixed reality dynamics, in the future, we’re not sure what that’s going to look like, because it’s not here yet. So, we need to experiment, figure out what that looks like.<br><b>Fabien Benetou:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, thank you. It’s actually a continuation of your question because you asked about the background environment using 360, and including the old model. It’s also a question that you know I was going to ask, and I guess Gavin did, because I’m a developer, you can imagine it too. If it’s not enough, if somehow there are features that I want to develop, and they are very weird, nobody else will care about it, and, as you say, as a start-up you can’t do everything, you need to put some priorities. What can I do? Basically, is it open source? if not, is there an API? If there is an API, what has the community built so far?<br><b>Gavin Menichini:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, great question. So, as of now, we currently don’t have any APIs or open SDKs, open source code for users to use. We’ve had this feature request a lot. And our CEO is pondering what his approach wants to be in the future. So, we do want to do something around that in the future. But, because we’re still so early stage, and we have so many things we have to focus on, it’s extremely important that we’re very careful with what we work on, and how focused, and how hard working we are towards those. As we continue to progress as a company, and as our revenue increases, as we raise subsequent rounds of funding, that gives us the flexibility to explore these things. And one of the biggest feature requests we’ve had is having an Immersed SDK for our streaming monitor technology so people can start to play with different variations of what we’re building. But I do know that Renji does not allow for any free, open source coding work whatsoever. Just for a few reasons legality-wise, and I think we had a few experiences in the past where we experiment with that, and it backfired to where developers were claiming they owed, they deserved equity, or funding. It was a hot mess. So, we don’t allow anyone to work for us for free, or to give us any form of software, to any regard, any work period, to prevent any legal issues, to prevent any claims like that ,which is kind of unfortunate. But he’s a stickler and definitely will not budge on that. But in the future, hopefully, we’ll have an SDK or some APIs that are opened up, or open source code, once we’re more successfully established for people to experiment and start making their own fun iterations to immerse on.&nbsp;<br><b>Brandel Zachernuk:&nbsp;</b>I have a question about the windows. You mentioned that, when somebody has a pro subscription, they can be socially connected, but not share screens. I presume, in an enterprise circumstance, people can see each other’s windows. Have you observed any ways in which people have used their windows more discursively, in terms of having them as props, essentially, for communicating with each other, rather than primarily, or solely for working on their own? The fact that they can move these monitors, these windows around, does that change anything about the function of them within a workflow or a discussion context?<br><b>Gavin Menichini:&nbsp;</b>Yeah. So, to clarify under the tier and your functionality. We have a free tier, where you can connect your computer and traverse the gap. You get one free virtual display. You cannot, on a free tier, ever share screens in all of our public rooms. You can’t share screens, regardless of your license. Here, the only place you can share screens is in a private collaboration room. Which means, you have to be on our elite tier, or a teams tier. On our elite tier, which is our mid-pro-solo tier, you can have up to three other people in the room with you, four total, and you can share screens with each other. And the default is, your screens are never shared. So, if you have four people in a room, and they each have three screens up, you cannot see anyone else’s screen until you voluntarily share your screen and confirm that screen. And then, it will highlight red, for security purposes. But if you’re an environment where, Brandel, you wanted to share your screen, when you share your screen and say, we’re all sitting at a conference room table, if I have my screens like, one, two, three, right here, and I share my middle screen, my screen is then going to pop up in your perspective to you. To where you have control of my shared screen. You can make it larger. Make it bigger. Shrink it, etc. And we’re also going to be building different environment anchors to where say, for example, in your conference room, and in a normal conference room you have a large tv on the wall, say, in virtual reality, you could take your screen and snap it to that place, and once it’s snapped into that little TV slot, that screen will be automatically shared and everyone sees it at that perspective, rather than their own perspective. And then, from a communication standpoint, we have teams who will meet together in different dedicated rooms, and then they’ll share screens, and look at data together. There’s... I can’t remember quite the name, it’s a software development team where something goes down, they have to very well come together. Devops teams come together, they share screens looking at data to fix a down server or something, and they can all see, and analyse that data together. And we’re exploring the different feature adds we can add to make that experience easier and more robust.<br><b>Brandel Zachernuk:&nbsp;</b>And so, yeah. My question is: Are you aware of the ways in which people make use of that in terms of being able to share and show more things? One of the things about desktop computing, even in the context where people are co-located, co-present in physical meet space, you don’t actually have very good performability of computer monitors. It kind of sucks in Zoom. It kind of sucks in real life, as well. Do people show and share differently, as a consequence of being in Immersed? Can you characterize anything about that?<br><b>Gavin Menichini:&nbsp;</b>Yes. So, the answer is yes. They have the ability to share more screens, and so, in meet space, in real-world, a funny term there for meet space, but. You can only have one computer screen if you’re working on a laptop, and that’s frustrating. Unless you have a TV, you have to airdrop, XYZ, whatever. But, in Immersed, you have up to five screens. And so, we have teams of four, and they’ll share two or three screens at once, and they can have a whole arrangement of data, 10 screens are being shared, and they can rearrange those individually so it all pops up in front of them, and then, they all rearrange them in order that they want, and they can all watch a huge sharing screen of data. That is not possible in real life because of the technology we provide to them. And then, there’s different iterations of that experience where, maybe, it’s two or three screens, it’s here, it’s there. And so, because of the core tech that we have where you can have multiple screens and then share each of those, that opens up the possibility for more data visualization, because you have more screen real estate. This opportunity to collaborate more effectively, and if you had one computer screen on Zoom, which as you mentioned, is challenging, or even in real life, because in real life you could have a computer and two TVs, but in Immersed you could have eight screens being shared at once.&nbsp;<br><b>Brandel Zachernuk:&nbsp;</b>And do you share control? Is it something where it’s only the person sharing it has the control, so other people would have read-only access? Or do you have the ability for people to be able to pass that control around? Send the user events such that everybody would be able to have shared control?<br><b>Gavin Menichini:&nbsp;</b>So, not right now, but we’re building that out. For the time being, we want everyone just to use collaboration tools they are currently using. Use Google Docs. Use Miro. Use Slack. Whatever. So, the current collaboration documents you guys are using now, we just want to use those applications on Immersed, because whatever you can run on your computer, you can run on your screen in Immersed. It is just your computer in Immersed. So, we tell people to do that. But now they get the added benefit of deeper connection. Just actually to be sitting next to your employee, or your colleague and then, now you can have multiple screens being shared. So, now it’s like a supercharged productivity experience, collaboration experience. Any other questions? I have about four minutes left, so I want to make sure I can answer all the questions you guys have.<br><b>Fabien Benetou:&nbsp;</b>I’ll make a one minute question. I’ll just say faster. If I understood correctly, the primitive is the screen. But is there anything else beyond the screen? Can you share 3D assets? Would the content can be pulled from the screen? If not, can you take capture of the screen. either as image, or video? And is it the whole screen only or part of the screen? And imagining you’ve done that, let’s say, part of the screen as a video of 30 seconds, can you make it permanent in the environment so that if I come back with colleagues tomorrow? Capture? Because that’s the challenge we have here all the time, we have great discussions and then, what happens to the content?<br><b>Gavin Menichini:&nbsp;</b>So, it’s in our pipeline to incorporate other assets that will be able to be brought into Immersed, and then remain persistent in the rooms. So, we’ve created the technology for persistent rooms, meaning, whatever you leave in there, it’s going to stay. Very similar to a conference room that you’ve dedicated for project. You put post notes around the wall, and obviously, come back to it the next day. So there same concept when in VR. And then, we also have plans to incorporate 3D assets, 3D CAD models, et cetera, into Immersed. But because you have your screens and teams are figuring out how to collaborate on 2D screens, we’re just, for the time being, we’re saying just continue to use your CAD model software on your computer 2D. But in the future we’ll have that capability. We also don’t want to be like F3D modelling VR software. So, we’re trying to find that balance. Which is why it’s been de-prioritized. But it is coming. And hopefully, in 2022 and then, we have also explored having video files that are in form of screens, or an image file, or post-it notes, We’re also going to improve our whiteboard experience, which is just some of one of our first iterations. And so, there’s a lot of improvements we’re going to be making in the future, in addition to different assets, photos, videos, 3D modelling software, et cetera. We’ve had that request multiple times and plan on building it in the future.<br><b>Fabien Benetou:&nbsp;</b>Oh, and super quick. It means you get in, you do the work, you get out, but you don’t have something like a trace of it as is right now?<br><b>Gavin Menichini:&nbsp;</b>As in persistence? As in you get in, you leave your screens there?<br><b>Fabien Benetou:&nbsp;</b>Or even something you can extract out of it. Frode was saying that, for example, he gets an email about the time he spent on a session, but is there something else? Again, because usually, you have maybe another eureka moment, but you have some kind of realization in the space, thanks to the space and the tools. And how can you get that it’s really a struggle.<br><b>Gavin Menichini:&nbsp;</b>I’m not sure, I’m sorry. I’m not sure I’m understanding your question correctly, but well, so it’s...<br><b>Brandel Zachernuk:&nbsp;</b>Maybe I can take a run of it. So, when people play VR games, at a VR arcade, one of the things that people will often produce is a sizzle reel of moments in that action. There’s a replay recording, an artifact of the experience. Of that process.<br><b>Gavin Menichini:&nbsp;</b>Okay, yes. So, for the time being there is no functionality in Immersed for that. But Oculus gives you the ability to record what you’re watching in VR. And you can pull that out and take that experience with you, as well as take snapshots. And then, we have no plans on incorporating that functionality into Immersed because Oculus has it, and I think HTC does, and other hardware manufacturers will provide that recording experience for you to then take away with you.<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Thank you very much, Gavin, a very interesting, real-world perspective on a very specific issue. So, very grateful. We’ll stay in touch. Run to your next meeting. When this journal issue is out, I’ll send you an update.<br><b>Gavin Menichini:&nbsp;</b>Thank you, Frode. It was a pleasure getting to chat with each of you. God bless. Hope you guys have a great Friday, weekend, and we’ll stay connected.<br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><br><b>Further Discussion</b><br><a href="https://youtu.be/2Nc5COrVw24?t=3987">https://youtu.be/2Nc5COrVw24?t=3987</a><br><br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Oh, okay. That sounds interesting. Yeah, we can look at changing times and stuff. So, briefly on this, and then on the meeting that I had with someone earlier today. This is interesting to us, because they are thinking a lot less VR than we are. But it is a real and commercial company and obviously a lot of his words were very salesy. Which is fine. But it literally is, rectangle in the room. That’s it. So, in many ways, it’s really, phenomenally, useful. And I’m very glad they’re doing it. I’m glad we have a bit of a connection to them now. But the whole issue of taking something out of the screen and putting it somewhere else, it was partly using their system that made me realize that’s not possible. And that’s actually kind of a big deal. So that’s that. And the meeting that Elliot and I had today, he mentioned who it was with. And I didn’t want to put too much into the record on that. But it was really interesting. The meeting was because of Visual-Meta. Elliot introduced us to these people. And Vint. Vint couldn’t be there today. We started a discussion. They have all kinds of issues with Visual-Meta. They love the idea, but then their implementation issue, blah, blah, blah. But towards the end, when I started talking about the Metaverse thing, they had no idea about the problems that we have learned. And they were really invigorated and stressed by it. So, I think what we’re doing here, in this community, is right on. I’m going to try now to rewrite some of the earlier stuff, to write a little piece over the weekend on academic documents in the Metaverse to highlight the issues. And if you guys want to contribute some issues to that document, that would be great or not, depending on how you feel. But I think they really understood that, what I said to them at the end is, if you have a physical meeting of a piece of paper, you can do whatever you want. But in the Metaverse, it can only do with the document, whatever the room allows you to, which is mind-blowingly crazy. And they represent a lot of really big publishers within medicine. They are under the National Institute of Health, as I understand. I’m not sure if Elliot is still in the room. So, yeah. It is good that we are looking in the right areas.&nbsp;<br><b>Brandel Zachernuk:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, that’s really constructive. For my part, one of the things that I’ve realized is that the hypertext people, the people who understand the value of things, like structured writing, and relationship linking, and things like that, are far better positioned than many, possibly most, to understand some of the questions and issues that are intrinsic to the idea of a Metaverse. I was watching, so I linked a podcast to some folks, it’s called, I think is it called Into The Metaverse, but it was a conversation between a VP of Unreal and the and the principal programmer, whatever, architect of Unity. So Vladimir VukiÄ‡eviÄ‡, who was who created Unreal and Unity, and&nbsp;VukiÄ‡eviÄ‡, I don’t know if I’m garbling that name, he was the inventor of WebGL. Which is the foundation for all of the stuff that we do in virtual reality on web, as well as just being very good for being able to do fancy graphics, as I do at work and things like that. But their view of what goes into a Metaverse what needs to be known about entities relationships descriptions and things was just incredibly naive. I’ll link the videos, but they see the idea of a browser as being intrinsic. And another person, who’s a 25-year veteran of Pixar and the inventor of the Universal Scene Description format, USD, which as you may know, Apple is interested in, sort of, promoting as being useful in the form of what this format of choice for augmented reality, quick look files, things like that. And again, just incredible naivete in terms of what are important things to be able to describe with regard to relationships, and constraints, and linkages of the kind that hypertext is. It’s the bread and butter of understanding how to make a hypertext relevant notionally and structurally, in a way that means that it’s (indistinct). So, yeah. It’s exciting, but it’s also distressing to see how much that thinking of people who are really titans of an interactive graphics field don’t know what this medium is. So, that looks fun.<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, it’s scary and fun. But I think we’re very lucky to have Bob here, because I’ve been very about the document and so on, and for about to say, “Well, actually, let’s use the wall as well”. It helps us think about going between spaces. And what I highlighted in the meeting earlier today was, what if I take one document from one repository, and let’s say, it has all the meta, so I’ve put a little bit here, a little bit there, but then, I have another document, from a different repository over here and I draw a connection between them. That connection now is a piece of information too. Where is stored? Who owns it? And how do I interact with that in the future? These are things that are not even begun to be addressed, because I think, all the companies doing the big stuff just want everything to go through their stuff.<br><b>Bob Horn:&nbsp;</b>And what kind is it? That is the connection.<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Yeah, exactly. So, we’re early naive days, so we need to produce some interesting worthwhile questions here. Fabien, I see your big yellow hand.â€¨<b>Video: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Nc5COrVw24?t=4369">https://youtu.be/2Nc5COrVw24?t=4369</a></b><br><b>Fabien Benetou:&nbsp;</b>I’ll put the less yellow hand on the side. Earlier when I said, I don’t know what I’m doing, it wasn’t like fake modesty or trying to undermine my work or this kind of thing. I actually mean it. I do a bunch of stuff and some of the stuff I do, I hope is interesting. I hope is even new, and might lead to other things. But in practice, it’s not purely random, and there are some let’s say, not heuristic, but there are some design principles, philosophy behind it, understanding of some, hopefully, core principle of urology, or cognitive science, or just engineering. But in practice, I think we have to be humble enough about this being a new medium. And figuring it out is not trivial, it’s not easy, and it’s not, I think, it is part of it, is intelligence and knowledge, but a lot of it is all that, plus luck, plus attempting.<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Oh, I agree with you. And I see that in this group, the reason I said it was I just wanted him to have a clue of the level of who we are in the room. That’s all. I think our ignorance in this room is great. I saw this graphic when I started studying, I haven’t been able to find the source, but it showed if you know this much about a subject, the circumference is the ignorance, it’s small. The more you know, the bigger circumference it is. And I found that to be such a graphic illustration of, you know something, you don’t know. We need to go all over the place. But at least we’re beginning to see some of the questions. And I think that’s a real contribution of what we’re doing here. So, we just got to keep on going. Also, as you know, we now have two presenters a month, which mean, for the next two or three months, I’ve only signed up one. Brandel is going to be doing, hopefully, in two to three weeks something, right?<br><b>Brandel Zachernuk:&nbsp;</b>Yeah. I’m still chipping away. Then I realized that there’s some reading I need to do, in order to make sure that I’m not mischaracterizing Descartes.<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Okay, that sounds like fun. Fabien, would you honour us, as well, with doing a hosted presentation over the next month or two or something?<br><b>Fabien Benetou:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, with pleasure.<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Fantastic! Our pathetic little journal is growing slightly less pathetic by the month.<br><b>Fabien Benetou:&nbsp;</b>I can give a teaser on... I don’t have a title yet, but let’s say, how a librarian, what a librarian would do if they were able to move walls around.<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>That’s very interesting. It was good the one we had on Monday, with Jad. It was completely different from what we’re looking at. Looking at identity. And for you to now talk about that aspect, is kind of a spatial aspect, that’s very interesting.<br><b>Bob Horn:&nbsp;</b>I’m looking forward to whatever you write about this weekend, Frode. Because for me, the summaries of our discussions, with some organization, not anywhere near perfect organization, not asking for that, but some organization, some patterns are what are important to me. And when I find really good bunches of those, then I can visualize them. So, I’m still looking for some sort of expression of levels of where the problems are as we see it now. In other words, there were the, what I heard today, with Immersed, was a set of problems at a certain level, to some degree. And then, a little bit in the organization of knowledge, but not a lot, but that’s what came up in our discussion afterwards and so forth. So, whenever there’s that kind of summary, I really appreciate&nbsp; whatever you do in that regard, because I know it’s the hardest work at this stage. So I’m trying to say something encouraging, I guess.<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, thank you, Bob. That’s very nice. I just put a link on this document that I wrote today. The next thing will be, as we discussed. But information has to be somewhere. It’s such an obvious thing, but it doesn’t seem to be acknowledged. Because in a virtual environment, we all know that you watch a Pixar animation, they’ve made every single pixel on the screen. There is no sky even. We know that. But when it becomes interactive, and we move things in and out. Oh, Brandel had a thing there.<br><b>Brandel Zachernuk:&nbsp;</b>One of the things that they that Guido Quaroni talks about, as as well as people have talked a bunch about, some of the influences and contributions of. Quilez makes Shadertoy, I don’t know if you’ve ever seen them or heard of that. But it’s this raymarched based fragment shader system for being able to do procedural systems. And so, none of the moss in brave, if you’ve seen that film, exists. Nobody modeled it. Nobody decided which pieces should go where. What they did was, Quilez has this amazing mind for a completely novel form of representation of data. It’s called the Signed Distance Fields&nbsp;raymarched&nbsp;shader. And so it’s all procedural. And all people had to do was navigate through this implicit virtual space to find the pieces that they wanted to stitch into the films. And so, it never existed. It’s something that was conjured on a procedural basis and then people navigated through it. So yes, things have to exist. But that’s not because people make it, sometimes. And sometimes it’s because people make a latent space, and then, they navigate it. And I think that the contrast between those two things is fascinating, in terms of what that means creative tools oblige us to be able to do. Anyway.<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Oh, yeah. Absolutely. Like No Man’s Sky and lots of interesting software out there. But it’s still not in the world, so to speak. One thing I still really want, and I’m going to pressure you guys every time, no, it’s not to write your bio, but it is some mechanism where, as an example, our journal, I can put it in a thing so that you guys can put it in your thing. Because then we can really start having real stuff that is our stuff. So if you can keep that in the back of your mind. Even if you can just spec how it should work, I’ll try to find someone to do it, if it’s kind of rote work and not a big framework for you guys.<br><b>Brandel Zachernuk:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, I definitely intend to play more with actually representing text again. And somebody made a sort of invitation slash prompt blast challenge to get my text renderings to be better. Which means that I’ll need something to do it better on. And so, yeah. I think that would be a really interesting target goal.<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Awesome. Fabien, I see you have your hand, but on that same request to you guys, imagine we already have some web pages where you can click at the bottom, view in VR, when you’re in the environment. That’s nice. Imagine if we have documents like that, that’ll be amazing. And I don’t know what that would mean, yet. There are some thoughts, but it goes towards the earlier. Okay, yes. Fabien, please?<br><b>Fabien Benetou:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, I think we need to go a bit beyond imagining. Then we can have some sandbox, some prototypes of the documents. We have recorded, that’s how I started, the first time I joined, you mentioned Visual-Meta. And then, I put a PDF and some of the media data in there. No matter how the outcome was gonna exist, so I definitely think that’s one of the most interesting way to do it. The quick word on writing, my personal fear about writing is that, I don’t know if you know the concept, and I have the name of the people of my tongue, but yeah, ID Depth. So the idea is that you have too many ideas, and then at some point, if you don’t realize some of them, if you don’t build, implement, make it happen, however the form is, it’s just crushing. And then, let’s say, if I start to write, or prepare for the presentation I mentioned just 30 minutes or 10 minutes ago, the excitement and the problem is, it’s for sure, by summarizing it, stepping back, that’s going to bring new ideas. Like, “Oh, now I need to implement. Now I need to test it”. There is validation on it. I’m just not complaining or anything. Just showing a bit my perspective of my fear of writing. And also because in the past, at some point I did just write. I did not code anything. It felt good in a way. But then also. a lot of it was, I don’t want to say bullshit but, maybe not as interesting as that or it was maybe a little, so I’m just personally trying to find the right balance between summarizing, sharing, having a way that the content can be reused, regardless of the implementation, any implementation. Just sharing my perspective there.<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>That is a very important perspective. And it is very important to share. And I think we’re all very different in this. And for this particular community, my job as, quote-unquote editor, is to try to create an environment where we’re comfortable with different levels. Like Adam, he will not write. Fine. I steal from Twitter, put it in the journal, and he approves it. Hopefully. Well, so far he has. So, if you want to write, write. But also, I really share, so strongly, the mental thing you talked about. We can’t know what it’s like to hear something until it exists. And we say, if an idea is important write it down, because writing it down, of course, helps clarifying. But that’s only if it’s that kind of an idea. Implementing, in demos and code is as important. I’ve been lucky enough to be involved with building our summer house, in Norway, doing a renovation here. And because it’s a physical environment, even doing it in SketchUp it’s not enough. I made many mistakes. Thankfully, there were experienced people who could help me see it in the real thing. Sometimes we had to put boards up in a room to see what it would feel like. So, yeah. Our imaginations are hugely constrained. So, it’s now 19 past. And Brandel was suggesting he had to go somewhere else. I think it’s okay, with a small group, if we finish half-past, considering this will be transcribed, anyway. And so, let’s have a good weekend. Unless someone wants a further topic discussion, which I’m totally happy with also.<br><b>Brandel Zachernuk:&nbsp;</b>Yeah. I’m looking forward to chatting on Monday. And I will read through what you sent to the group that you discussed things with today. Connecting to people with problems that are more than graphical, and more than attends to the Metaverse, I think is really fascinating. Providing they have the imagination to be able to see that, what they are talking about is a “Docuverse”. Is these sort of connected concepts that Bob has written about. I’ve got a book but it’s on the coffee table. The pages after 244. The characterization of the actual information and decision spaces that you have. It’s got the person with the HMD but then it’s sort of situated in an organization where there are flows of decisions. And I think that, recognizing that we can do work on that is fascinating.&nbsp;<br><b>Bob Horn:&nbsp;</b>I can send that to everybody, if you like.<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Oh, I have it. So without naming names or exactly who I was speaking to today since we’re still recording. The interesting thing is, of course, this feeds the, starting with the Visual-Meta, it feeds into some part of the organization desperately wants something like that and they’ve been pushing for years. But there are resources, and organization, and communication, all those real-world issues. So then, a huge problem is, I come in as an outsider and I say, “Hey, here’s a solution. It’s really cheap and simple”. It’s kind of like I’m stealing their thunder, right? I am not doing that, I’m just trying to help them realize what they already want to do. And today, when they talked about different standards, I said, “Look. Honestly, what’s in Visual-Meta, I don’t care. If you could, please, put it in BibTeX, the basic stuff, but if you want to have some json in there, it’s not something I would like, but if you want to do it there’s nothing wrong with that”. So, to try to make these people feel that they are being enabled, rather than someone kind of moving them along is emotionally, human difficult. And also, for them to feel that they’re doing something with Vint Cerf. All of that, hopefully, will help them feel a bit of excitement. But I also think that the incredibly hard issues with the Metaverse that we’re bringing up also unlock something in their imagination. Because, imagine if we, at the end of this year, we have a demo, where we have a printed document, and then we pretend to do OCR, we don’t need to do it live, right? And then, we have it on the computer, very nice. And now, suddenly, we put on a headset. You all know where I’m going with this, right? We have that thing. But then, as the crucial question you kept asking Gavin, and I’m glad you both asked it, Fabien and Brandel, what happens to the room when you leave it? What happens to the artifacts and the relationship if we solve some of that? What an incredibly strong demo that would be. And also, was it a little bit of a wake-up call for you guys to see that this well-funded new company is still dealing with only rectangles?<br><b>Brandel Zachernuk:&nbsp;</b>No. I know from my own internal experience just how coarse the thinking is, even with better funding.<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Yeah. And the greatest thing about our group is, we have zero funding. And we have zero bosses. All we have is our honesty, community, and passion. Now, it’s a very different place to invent from. But look at all the great inventions. Vint was a graduate student, Tim Berners-Lee was trying to do something in a different lab. You know all the stories. Great innovations have to come from groups like this. I don’t know if we’re going to invent something. I don’t know. I don’t really care. But I really do care, desperately, that we contribute to the dialogue.<br><b>Brandel Zachernuk:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, I think that’s valuable. I think that the fact that we have your perspective on visual forms of important distilled information thought is going to be really valuable. And one of the things I’d like to do, given that you said that so many people make use of Vision 2050 is start with that as a sculpture, as a system to be able to jump into further detail. Do you have more on that one?&nbsp;<br><b>Bob Horn:&nbsp;</b>Well, I can take it apart. I can do what different things we want to do with it. For example, when we were clearing it with the team that worked that created some of the thought that went into it, the back cast thought, I would send the long trail of the four decades of transportation to Boeing, to Volkswagen, and to Toyota. I didn’t send it to the rest of the people. So, I could take that, I actually took that out and sent a PDF of that, only that to them. And that’s one dimension. Another dimension is that five years later, I worked on another project that was similar called Poll Free. Which is also on my website. And it narrowed the focus to Europe, to the European Union, rather than the whole world. But the structure is similar in many ways. So each one of those are extractable. Then also, I have a few...&nbsp; The two or three years after working on the Vision 2050, I would give lectures of different kinds. And people would ask me, “Well, how are we doing on this or that requirement?” And so, I would try to pull up whatever data there was, two, or three, or four years later, and put that in my slides, so there, that material is available. So, that we can extract, you could demo, at least that, “Here’s what we thought in 2010 and here’s what it looked like in 2014”. For one small chunk of the whole picture. So, yeah. And I have several, maybe I don’t know, six or eight, at least of those, that where I could find data easily and fast. So, there’s a bit of demo material there that one could portray a different kind of a landscape than the one that you were pointed out just a minute ago.<br><b>Brandel Zachernuk:&nbsp;</b>Yeah. That would be really interesting to play with. I was just looking to add some of the things. I think that the one thing that I had seen of the Vision 2050 was the fairly simple one, it’s a sort of a four, this node graph here, the nine billion people live well and within the limits of the planet I hadn’t seen yet. The sustainable pathway toward a sustainable 2050 document that you linked here on your site, which has a ton more information. And, yeah. One of the things that I’m curious about, one of the things that I think I will do to play with it first is actually get it into, not into a program that I write, but into a 3D modelling APP, to tear it apart, and think about the way in which we might be able to create and distribute space for it. But first, do you have thoughts about what you would do if this was an entire room? It obviously needs to be a pretty big mural, but if it was an entire room, or an entire building, do you have a sense of the way in which it would differ?<br><b>Bob Horn:&nbsp;</b>Until you ask the question, and put it together with the pages from the old book, I haven’t really thought of that. But from many of the places in Vision 2050 one would have pathways like this. This was originally a pert chart way back when that I was visualizing, because I happened to have, early my career edited a book on pert charts for Dupont. And so, that’s a really intriguing question. To be extracting in and laying it out and then, connecting those and also flipping the big mural, the time-based mural in Vision 2050, making that flat, bringing different parts of it up, I think would be one of the first ways that one would try to explore that, because then, one could (indistinct) pathways, and alternatives, and then linkages. So, they’re different. Depending on one’s purpose, thinking purpose, one would do different things.<br><b>Fabien Benetou:&nbsp;</b>Brief note here. I believe, using Illustrator to make the visuals, I believe Illustrator can also save to SVG. And SVG then can be relatively easily extruded to transform a 2D shape into a 3D shape. Honestly, doing that would be probably interesting but very basic, or very naive. It’s still, I think, a good step to extrude part of the graph with different depth based on, I don’t know, colour, or meaning, or position, or something like this. So, I think it could be done. But, if you could export one of the poster in that format, in SVG, I think it would be fun to tinker with. But I think, at some point, you personally will have to consider, indeed, the question that Brandel asked. If you have a room, rather than a wall beyond the automatic extraction or extrusion, how would you design it?<br><b>Brandel Zachernuk:&nbsp;</b>Yeah. It’s something that I think would be really useful as an exercise, if you want to go through one of those murals and with a sketchbook, just pencils. And at some point, you can go through with us to characterize what I think, like you said, different shapes, different jobs call for different shapes through that space. But one can move space around, which is exciting. Librarians can move their walls around.<br><b>Bob Horn:&nbsp;</b>I was going to say the other, if you strike another core, just as from the demonstration we saw earlier this morning. The big mural could be on one wall. There was a written report. There is a 60 or 80-page report that could be linked in various ways to it. And it exists. And then, there’s also, in that report, there’s a simplification of the big mural. It reduces the 800 steps in the mural to about 40. And it’s a visual table look. So, already there are three views, three walls, and we’ve already imagined putting it flat on the floor and things popping up from it. All right, there we go. There’s a room for you.<br><b>Brandel Zachernuk:&nbsp;</b>Exciting, yeah. I think that’s a really good start. And from my perspective, I think that’s something that I can and will play with is, starting from that JPEG of the PDF, I’ll peel pieces of that off and try to arrange them in space, thinking about some of the stuff that Fabien’s done with the Visual-Meta, virtual&nbsp;Visual-Meta.&nbsp;As well as what Adam succeeded in doing, in terms of pulling the dates off, because I think that there’s some really interesting duality of views, like multiplicity of representations that we can kind of get into, as well as being able to leverage the idea of having vastly different scales. When you have a, at Apple we call it a type matrix, but just the texts and what what’s a heading what’s a subhead. But the thing is that, except in the most egregious cases, which we sometimes do at Apple, the biggest text is no more than about five times the smallest text. But in real space you can have a museum, and the letters on the museum wall or in a big room are this big. And then you have little blocks like that thing. And there’s no expectation for there to be mutually intelligible. There’s no way you can read this, while you’re reading that. But because of the fact that we have the ability to navigate that space, we can make use of those incredibly disparate scales. And I think that’s incumbent on us to reimagine what we would do with those vastly different scales that we have available, as a result of being able to locomote through a virtual space.<br><b>Bob Horn:&nbsp;</b>Well, let me know if you need any of these things. I can provide, somehow. I guess you and I could figure out how to do a dropbox for Illustrator or any other thing that can be useful for you.<br><b>Brandel Zachernuk:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, thank you. I may ask for the Illustrator document. One of the things that I’ve been recently inspired by, so there’s an incredible team at Apple that I’m trying to apply for called prototyping. And one of the neat things that they have done over the years is describe their prototypic process. And it mostly involves cutting JPEGs apart and throwing them into the roughest thing possible in order to be able to answer the coarsest questions possible first. And so, I’m very much looking forward to doing something coarse ground with the expectation that we have a better sense of what it is we would want to do with more high fidelity resources. So, hopefully that will bear fruit and nobody should be, hopefully not, too distraught by misuse of the material. But I very much enjoy the idea of taking a fairly rough hand to these broad questions at first, and then, making sure that refinement is based on actual resolution, in the sense of being resolved, rather than pixel density.<br><b>Bob Horn:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, well, okay. If you want JPEGs we can make JPEGs too.<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>You said almost as a throwaway thing there. Traverse. But one thing that I learned, Brandel, particularly with your first mural of Bob’s work is that, traversal, unless you’re physically walking if you have room scale opportunity, is horrible. But being able to pull and push is wonderful. And I think that kind of insight that we’re learning by doing is something we really should try to record. So, I’m not trying to push you into an article. But if you have a few bullets that you want to put into Twitter, or sent to me, or whatever, as in, this, in your experience has caused stomach pain, this hasn’t. Because also, yesterday, I saw a... You know I come from a visual background, and have photography friends, and do videos, and all that stuff, suddenly, a friend of mine, Keith, from some of you have met, we were in SoHo, where he put a 8k 360 camera, and it was really fun. So, I got all excited, went home, looked up a few things, and then I found the Stereo 180 cameras. And I finally found a way to view it on the Oculus. It was a bit clunky, but I did. It was an awful experience. There’s something about where you place your eye. When we saw the movie, Avatar, it was really weird that the bit that is blurry would actually be sharp as well, but somewhere else. Those kinds of effects. So, to have a stereoscopic, if it isn’t exactly right on both eyes and you’re looking at the exact, it’s horrible. So, these are the things we’re learning. And if we could put it into a more listy way, that would be great. Anyway, just since you mentioned.<br><b>Brandel Zachernuk:&nbsp;</b>Yes. It’s fascinating. And that’s something that Mark Anderson also observed when he realized that, unfortunately, the Fresnel lenses that we make use of in current generation hardware means that, it’s not particularly amenable to looking with your eyes like that. You really have to be looking through the center of your headset in order to be able to get the best view. You have this sense of the periphery. But will tire anybody who tries to read stuff down there, because their eyes are going to start hurting.<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Yeah. I still have problems getting a real good sharp focus. Jiggle this, jiggle that. But, hey! Early days, right? So when it comes to what we’re talking about with Bob’s mural, and the levels, and the connections, and all of that good stuff, it seems to be an incredibly useful thing to experiment with exactly these issues. What does it actually mean to explode it, et cetera? So, yeah. Very good.&nbsp;<br><b>Fabien Benetou:&nbsp;</b>Yeah. I imagine that being shared before. But just in case, Mike Elgier, who is, or at least who was, I’m not sure right now, but a typist and designer at Google, on the UXL product. Wrote some design principle a couple of years ago. And not all of these were his, but he illustrated it quite nicely. So, I think it’s a good summary.&nbsp;<br><b>Brandel Zachernuk:&nbsp;</b>Yes, I agree. He’s still at Google he was working on Earth and YouTube. Working on how to present media, and make sure that it works seamlessly so that you’re not lying about what the media is, but in terms of presenting a YouTube video in VR in a way that it isn’t with no applied and like I see it screen or whatever. But also, making sure that it’s something that you can interact with as seamlessly as possible. So, it’s nice work, and hopefully, if Google ramps up its work back into AR, VR, then they can leverage his abilities. Because they’ve lost a lot of people who are doing really interesting things. I don’t know if you saw, Don McCarthy has now moved to New York Times to work on 3D stuff there. And that’s very exciting for them. But a huge blow for Google not to have them back.<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Just adding this to our little news thing. Right. Excellent. Yeah. Let’s reconvene on Monday. This is good. And, yeah. That’s all just wonderful. Have a good weekend.<br><br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><h3 id="8A35809D-A972-4525-810E-170F5B5DBC92">Chat Log</h3><br><br>16:46:14 From Fabien Benetou : my DIY keyboard passthrough in Hubs ;) <br><a href="https://twitter.com/utopiah/status/1250121506782355456">https://twitter.com/utopiah/status/1250121506782355456</a> <br>using my webcam desktop<br>16:48:25 From Frode Hegland : Cool Fabien<br>16:50:49 From alanlaidlaw : that’s the right call.

We lose awareness of the magic reading skills that took us years to learn — these marks on screen or paper somehow create mental images or sounds, feelings like laughter, disagreement, anger, plans for action, anything, in our heads. If we pause from the flow, we may reflect about the text’s metadata — who wrote this; when did they write it; how much do we have to pay for it; when was it written? — we want to know lots details about the text. <br>	If we are feeling critical, we may notice the typography: some text is italic, the page numbers are in a different font, there are rivers in the paragraphs, and the kerning perhaps leaves a lot to be desired. Then we notice how the author italicises Latin phrases, like <i>ad nauseam</i>, but does not italicise Latin abbreviations like e.g. for example.<br>	If we are programmers, we might wonder how the text works, how it was actually implemented. What is the data format? How did the writer and the developers store this information, and yet convey a coherent stream of consciousness to the readers? Some texts mix in computed texts, like indices and tables of contents; then there are footnotes, side notes, cross references, running headings, page numbers — all conventional ways of mixing in different types of text to help the reader.<br>	If the text is on a web page or represented in VR, even more will be happening. VR text is typically interactive. Perhaps it scrolls and pans in interesting ways, is reactive to different sorts of reading devices, fitting into different screen sizes and colour gamuts, and it probably interactively needs information from the reader. Increasingly, the reader will need to subscribe to the text, and the details of that are held in very complex metadata stored in the cloud, far away from the text itself yet linked back to it so the reader can have access to it.<br><br><h3 id="27A248B9-66ED-454B-8883-01289424D93A">The author’s experience of text</h3><b><br></b><br>For the sake of concreteness, familiarity, and simplicity, we will use HTML as an initial case study. <br>       HTML is a familiar, well-defined notation, and it is powerful enough to represent almost any form of text. For example, Microsoft Word — which provides a WYSIWYG experience for the author — could easily represent all of its text using HTML; in fact, Word now uses a version of XML (which is basically a fussy version of HTML) to do so. Furthermore, in this chapter it’s helpful that we can talk about HTML on the two-dimensional printed (or PDF or screen) page, unlike examples from VR. (If we had used Microsoft Word as the running example, it has plenty of mixed texts, like tables of contents, references, forms. Even basic features like tables and lists are very different sorts of text than the main document text.)<br>	Despite the widespread use of HTML across the web, and its widespread use in highly critical applications, such as managing bank accounts and healthcare services and writing pilot operating manuals for aircraft, HTML is a surprisingly quirky and unreliable language for text. The main reason for its quirkiness is that HTML was originally designed to implement some innovative ideas about distributed hypertext, and nobody then thought it would develop to need designing to be safe to use in critical applications, let alone that it would need designing to integrate reliably with many other notations.<br>	We’ll give some examples. If you get bored with the details, do skip forward to the end of this chapter to see what needs to be learned to improve future mixed text.<br>	Remember these examples illustrate problems that can occur when any text mixes any notations, but using HTML makes it easy to describe. (Also, you can easily play with my examples in any web browser.) We’ll take <i>very</i> simple examples of mixed text, not least to wonder why even simple mixes don’t work perfectly. For brevity, we’ll ignore the complexities and flaws of mixed texts like tables of contents, indices, and so on (there aren’t many word processors that ensure even just the table of contents has the right page numbers <i>all the time</i>).<br>	In addition to the text, styles and layout HTML can define, HTML allows developers to mix comments in the text. Comments are texts that are intended to be read by developers but not seen by readers. Perhaps a developer is in a hurry for people to read a text but they haven’t yet completely finished it. How will the developer keep track of what they want to write but haven’t yet done? One easy solution is to use a comment: the developer writes a comment like “XX I need to finish writing this section by December” or “I need to check this! What’s the citation?” or “I must add the URL later”, but the readers of the text won’t see these private comments. The developer, as here, might use a code like XX so that they can easily use search facilities to find their important comments where they need to do more work.<br>	The actual notation for comment in HTML is &lt;!-- <i>comment</i> --&gt;. Here, I’ve used another mixture of texts: the italic typewriter font word <i>comment</i> (in the previous sentence) is being used to mean any text that is used as comment and hence will not be visible to the text’s reader.<br>	One problem with this HTML notation is that it is not possible to comment out arbitrary HTML: if it already contains comments, where the commented out HTML will end with the first --&gt;, not with the last.<br>	Why would you want to comment out entire blocks of HTML, which might contain further comments? A very common reason to do this is that the HTML text is not working properly: there is some sort of bug in the text. One of the fastest ways of finding the cause of the problem is to systematically comment out chunks of the text. If commenting out <i>this</i> bit doesn’t affect the bug, the bug must be somewhere else. Try again, and continue doing this until the bug is precisely located. (There are systematic ways to do this that speed up the debugging, like binary search.)<br>       HTML is structured using tags. A simple tag is &lt;p&gt;, which generally starts a paragraph. Tags can also have parameters (HTML calls them <i>attributes</i>) to provide more specific control over their meaning or features. For example, &lt;p title = "This paragraph is about HTML"&gt; typically makes the specified title text appear when the user mouses over the paragraph. The spaces in this title mean that it has to be written between two quote symbols (the two " characters) — otherwise the four words here after the first, paragraph, is, about and HTML, would be taken as further attributes; the title would just be set to This, and all the other words would be <i>silent</i> errors. However, we obviously want the entire text to be a <i>single</i> value made up of all the words and spaces between them. Unfortunately what is obvious to us is not obvious to HTML. HTML has to cope with many authors’ ideas that are not obvious, most of which won’t be so obvious to us, so it needs another feature to avoid it having to somehow intuit what we think we mean. So, sometimes, but not always, we have to use " around attribute values.<br>       Unfortunately, using " around attribute values means that yet another random convention is needed if we need " itself to be part of a value. <br>       For example,  <br><center>&lt;h1 title = "This is the beginning of the book "The Hobbit""&gt;<br></center>does not work. Instead, the HTML author is required to use a single quote instead. Here, this would do: <br><center>&lt;h1 title = 'This is the beginning of the book "The Hobbit"'&gt;<br></center>— which solves that problem, but now we are in a mess if for any reason we need both sorts of quote. So, what about the title of a book about a book? <br><center>&lt;h1 title = "J. R. R. Tolkien's "The Hobbit""&gt;<br></center>which needs to use both " and ' in the attribute value! HTML cannot do that, at least without relying on even more conventions: for instance, knowing that any character in HTML can be written as &amp;<i>code</i>; we could correctly but tediously write <br><center>&lt;h1 title="J. R. R. Tolkien&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;The Hobbit&amp;#34;"&gt;<br></center>This is just bonkers isn&amp;#39;t it? It relies on the author knowing what numeric codes (or names) need to be used for the problematic characters, and also relies on the author testing that it works.<br>       Other languages use a different, much better, system to allow authors to mix types of text. For instance in the widely-used programming language C, within a value like "stuff", characters can be represented by themselves, or more generally codes, after a slash. Thus \' means ', \" means ", and more generally \<i>nnn</i> means the character with code <i>nnn</i> like HTML’s own &amp;#<i>nn</i>; but using octal rather than decimal. This approach means in C one could write a value for a book title like<br><center>title = "J. R. R. Tolkien\'s \"The Hobbit\"";<br></center>and it would work as intended — and it is much easier for the author to read and write. Note that the \' is being used correctly even though in this case a bare ' alone, without a slash, would have been equally acceptable too. So one must ask: given this nicer design of C, and nicer design or lots of similar, popular, textual languages which pre-dated HTML, why did HTML use a scheme that is so awkward?<br>       Note that a scheme like HTML’s that is <i>sometimes</i> rather than <i>always</i> awkward means that authors are rarely familiar with the rare problems. The problems come as surprises. <br>       HTML gets worse.<br>       HTML has ways to introduce further types of text, such as CSS, SVG, MathML, and JavaScript. For example, &lt;script&gt; document.write(27*39); &lt;/script&gt; is JavaScript mixed inside of HTML text. Here the JavaScript is being used to work out a sum (namely, 27 times 39) that the author found easier to write down in JavaScript than work out in their head. Moreover, JavaScript is often used inside HTML to generate CSS and SVG and other languages (such as SQL, which we will return to below).<br>       What an author can write in JavaScript has many very unusual constraints. <br>       Consider this simple example: <br><center>&lt;script&gt; var endScript = "&lt;/script&gt;"; &lt;/script&gt;<br></center>This will not work, because HTML finishes the JavaScript prematurely at the first &lt;/script&gt; rather than the second one. HTML does not recognise JavaScript’s syntax, so it has no idea that the first &lt;/script&gt; is inside a string in JavaScript and was not intended to be HTML at that moment, which the second one was. <br>The workaround for this is a bit bizarre: HTML’s &amp; entities can be used to disguise the &lt;&gt; characters from HTML! Here’s how it can be done: <br><center>&lt;script&gt; var endScript = "&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;"; &lt;/script&gt;<br></center>I think we get so used to this sort of workaround, we lose sight of how odd it is to have to understand how two languages, here HTML and JavaScript, mess each other up before we can safely use either of them<br>       Here, next, is some routine JavaScript that displays an alert for the developer if (in this case) x&gt;y, which might mean something has gone wrong:<br><center>&lt;script&gt; if( x &gt; y ) alert("--&gt; x &gt; y"); &lt;/script&gt;<br></center>Assume the author, or another author working on the same text, decided to comment out a stretch of HTML for some reason. Weirdly, this JavaScript will now produce the text “x &gt; y"); --&gt;”, because the ‘harmless’ arrow in the JavaScript code has turned into HTML’s --&gt; end of comment symbol, even though it is still inside JavaScript. Confusingly, the JavaScript used to work before it was commented out!<br>       Ironically, because HTML is designed to ignore errors, when it is mixed with JavaScript, as here, authors may make serious errors (much worse than this simple example) that are ignored and which nothing helps them detect. In complex projects, especially with multiple authors sharing the same texts, such errors are soon impossible to avoid, and are very hard to track down and fix because they are caused by strange interactions between incompatible text notations. They aren’t errors <i>in</i> HTML; they aren’t errors <i>in</i> JavaScript; they are errors that only arise <i>inside</i> JavaScript <i>inside</i> HTML text.<br>       Here’s another confusion. Like HTML, JavaScript itself has comments. Thus, in Javascript, anything written after // to the end of the line is ignored. But // &lt;/script&gt; is a JavaScript comment ignored by JavaScript but includes valid HTML that is <i>not</i> ignored by HTML.<br>       To summarise so far: HTML is a text notation that allows, indeed encourages and relies on, other languages (such as JavaScript) being mixed in, but HTML and these languages were developed independently, and they interact in weird and unexpected ways that can catch authors and readers out.<br>       These examples, chosen to be quick and easy to explain, may give the misleading impression that the problems are trivial. They may also, wrongly, give the impression that mixed text problems are restricted to HTML. But it gets worse. <br>       An HTML text may use JavaScript that needs to use the language SQL, a popular database language. The problem is that when SQL is embedded in JavaScript in HTML, it raises security risks. “SQL injection” is the most familiar problem.<br>       A user using an HTML text on a web page may be asked to enter some text, like some product they want to buy. The product needs to be found in the store’s database, so SQL is used to make the connection. But if, instead of a product description, they type a bit of valid SQL, this SQL will go straight to the SQL engine. This is the SQL injection, and then the user (presumably a hacker) can get the SQL backend to do bad things. <br>       If a web site allows (by accident and ignorance) SQL injection, a hacker can do much damage by taking over and programming the SQL database. In addition to this problem, SQL has its own different weird rules for strings and mixing texts, making examples like the simple HTML+JavaScript problems look simple. To make matters worse, an SQL database may well store HTML and JavaScript, for instance to make nice descriptions of the products the store sells. So mixed text can mix text.<br>       Hackers can have fun with the bugs. There was a UK company registered under the name DROP TABLE "COMPANIES";—LTD, a company name that is contrived to be valid SQL. If injected into a database with a table called companies it would drop (that is, delete) the company’s data.<br><br><h3 id="50790487-E26A-4270-8B52-8895EF850849">Interesting aside…</h3><b><br></b><br>We’ve mentioned comments, and shown how they can be useful for authors of texts. HTML also allows text to be optionally hidden or made visible to <i>readers</i>, a sort of generalisation of comments but available to both authors and readers. This feature is the hidden attribute. Thus &lt;span&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt; says hello, but &lt;span hidden&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt; says nothing at all for the reader, a <i>little</i> bit like &lt;!-- hello --&gt; would too. Ironically, to do anything useful, like allowing text — maybe an error message — to appear only when it is needed requires using JavaScript to dynamically edit HTML attributes (here, to interactively disable or enable hidden).<br><br><h3 id="B62747B3-E4DD-42B8-91F1-5079F26C302F">Mixed texts in single systems</h3><b><br></b><br>Instead of mixing two text systems, like HTML and JavaScript, it ought to be easier to use a single integrated system. I’ve already hinted that there is more to the mixing of single-system texts like mixing in tables of contents into documents, but let’s stick with “trivial” mixing — because even that goes awry (and its weirdness is easier to explain briefly).<br>       I wrote this chapter using Microsoft Word. For the examples in HTML, I copied and pasted the text in and out of this chapter into a web browser, ran the text, and double-checked it did what I said it did. As I improved my discussion of the examples, text went backwards and forwards — hopefully without introducing errors or dropping off details, like the last &gt; character in a bodged cut-and-paste. It would have been easier and more reliable had I used an integrated mixed text system like Mathematica, then the entire text could have been authored in one place and could have stayed in place without any cut-and-pastes. <br>       In HTML if I say “&lt;hr&gt; is a horizontal rule,” then I have already used up the four letters &lt;hr&gt; to display themselves, namely as &lt;, h, r, and &gt;. (The fact that I actually had to write &amp;lt;hr&amp;gt; is another HTML mixed text problem.) In HTML I can’t reuse the <i>same</i> text to show what this &lt;hr&gt; does. However since Mathematica is programmable, I can write &lt;hr&gt; once and get it displayed numerous times, and each time processed in any way I like: sometimes to see the specific characters, sometimes to see how it renders (for instance as it would in HTML, as a horizontal rule), and sometimes to do arbitrary things. How many characters is it? 4. And if I changed the &lt;hr&gt; to, say, &lt;hr style = "width: 50%; height: 1cm"&gt;, that 4 would change to the correct value of 38 <i>without me doing anything</i>.<br>	While Mathematica is an example of a sophisticated system originally designed for mixing text with mathematics, it still has text-mixing design flaws. For example, a Mathematica feature for embedding text inside text — exactly what this chapter is about — is called a string template in its terminology. String templates use the notation &lt;* … *&gt; to indicate a place to mix arbitrary Mathematica text into strings of otherwise ordinary text, using &lt;* … *&gt; a bit like HTML’s own &lt;script&gt; … &lt;/script&gt; notation. <br>       For example, here is a single line easily written in Mathematica:<br><center>“The value of &#960; is &lt;* N[4ArcTan[1]] *&gt;” turns into “The value of &#960; is 3.14159”<br></center>	Very nice, but how would you write a string template that explains how to insert Mathematica text? You’d want to do this because using string templates to explain string templates would ensure the explanations were exactly correct. Indeed, Mathematica comes with a comprehensive user manual written as a Mathematica text, which does exactly this to illustrate how all its features work. Unfortunately, you can’t document string templates so easily (without complex and arbitrary workarounds). If I had written the example above entirely in Mathematica, the first &lt;*, which you are supposed to read as showing how to use the mixed text feature, would <i>already</i> have been expanded, so the example wouldn’t work at all. “The value of &#960; is 3.14159” turns into “The value of &#960; is 3.14159” doesn’t say anything helpful!<br>	Mathematica allows you to write special characters from other texts explicitly. Thus the Greek (or Unicode) symbol \[pi] written in ordinary text can be used to mean &#960; itself. If they had thought of having \[Less], which they don’t, then the &lt;* problem would have been fixed. Yet they have LessEqual, for &#8804;, and lots more symbols. The omissions, like having no abbreviation Less, are arbitrary, even when they are needed, because Mathematica <i>itself</i> made &lt; a special character! The designers of systems like HTML and Mathematica don’t seem to realise that a simple feature needs checking off for compatibility right across the language — when string templates were introduced in Version 10.0 of Mathematica, evidently nobody thought to go back over the basic text notations introduced in Version 1.<br>	There are various workarounds of course, which perhaps experienced Mathematica users will be shouting at me. Ordinarily, though, an author of a text won’t realise workarounds are needed until after something <i>unexpected</i> goes wrong, then they have to waste time trying to find the problem, then find an <i>ad hoc</i> solution using tricks they have to work out for themselves. Remember, “experienced” authors are just those who have already come across and overcome these “trivial” problems. String templates are clever, but suddenly what was supposed to be empowering mixed text feature has turned into a slippery, wiggling eel.<br>	We should not admire experienced authors who know all the problems and workarounds for mixed text. We should be despairing at the people who design mixed systems that don’t work reliably together.<br><br><h3 id="91A7FB28-03F6-45EF-90A8-D4B5B924014F">Future text mixed with AI and …</h3><b><br></b><br>This chapter has discussed the unavoidable need for interleaved mixed text, so text can fulfill its many purposes — whether for authors or readers. It showed (mostly by way of HTML-based examples) that many practical problems remain. Mixing text leverages enormous versatility, but at the cost of complexity. The devil is in the details.<br>	We hinted that embedded languages like JavaScript can be used to help the author add power and features to text to enrich the readers’ experience. The example we gave was simple, but made the point: if the author does not know what 27 times 39 is, they can get JavaScript to work it out and insert the answer. Another example would be to display the date — JavaScript knows that even if the author doesn’t. These are simple examples of mixed text that build on computational features.<br>	The world of computation is rapidly expanding in scope and impact with new tools. Examples that can transform the author’s experience of writing include such AI tools as<br>	<a href="https://www.gomoonbeam.com/">https://www.gomoonbeam.com</a>â€¨	<a href="https://elicit.org/">https://elicit.org</a>â€¨	<a href="https://lex.page/">https://lex.page</a>, and more.<br>These fascinating AI tools can do research, can do writing, and can inspire people out of writer’s block. There are surprisingly many such tools, leveraging every gap imaginable in the writing and reading process. We are still learning how AI can help, and every way it helps relies on mixing in more forms of text together — they didn’t mix, then they would not be contributing directly to the text or the author’s work.<br>	A final example is the use of programmable systems like Mathematica and R, which can mix text and computation and AI, as well as access curated databases of all manner of sources that can help the author. Unlike normal AI systems that are generally packaged up to do one thing well, Mathematica and R can be programmed by the author to help in any way.<br>	Mathematica, for instance, not only includes AI and ML and lots more, but can draw a map of Africa, get the country names and boundaries right and up to date, and find out all other details, like the weather in Sudan, its GDP or its adult literacy, even for very the day the reader reads about it, and mix it all in to the text the author is writing. Indeed, research papers often require detailed computations, often involving statistics, and doing this reliably mixed <i>in</i> the text, as Mathematica can, makes the papers much more reliable than when the computations being done conventionally — that is, done elsewhere and manually copied-and-pasted into the text, often introducing typos and other errors, as well as raising problems of the author forgetting to update the statistics when something relevant in the paper is updated. Consistency is a problem best solved by computers doing the text mixing.<br><br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><h3 id="DE8873E1-81E3-4237-9411-C5CF0B554C68">Conclusions</h3><b><br></b><br>The future of text requires and cannot avoid mixing different sorts of text. We already interleave all sorts of text without thinking and often without problems. Occasionally, however, things get tricky. When we use internet technologies to leverage our mixed texts, they can be read and used by millions of people. This means that what seem like arcane tricky things to us and of no real importance can happen to hundreds or thousands of people, and can have dire consequences for them.<br>       Unfortunately, mixing different types of text is a mess. Text has become very powerful thanks to computers and computation; but text has also become unreliable thanks to the poor design and inconsistencies between different types of text. We gave examples of the mess of HTML and JavaScript being mixed, and examples of mixed text problems <i>within</i> the single Mathematica application. <br>	Developers keep adding new types of text to representations, historically HTML being a notable example, that were never intended to be extended so far as they have been. And each new type of text (CSS, MathML, etc) has to work with other and all previous types of text that did not anticipate it — to say nothing of the complexities of backwards compatibility with earlier versions of each type of text. The Catch-22 of “improving” the design of text often means compromising lots of text authored before the design was improved.<br>	Special cases routinely fail, and workarounds are complex and fragile. In a saner world, HTML, JavaScript, SQL, and all the other languages would have been designed to work closely and better together, with no need for author workarounds. <br>       It’s maybe too late to start again, but here are a few ideas that may help:<br><li>Authors should use checking systems, and use servers that check for known problems (like SQL injection). I’ve suggested that the standards for languages like HTML are inadequate, but at least checking that your text conforms to relevant standards is a start. Like spell-checking, it won’t fix all your problems, but it’s still really worth doing.</li><br><li>When new forms of text are invented, ensure they work well with existing types of text — in particular, by reporting errors so that authors do not release unreliable texts to unsuspecting readers. An extreme form of this idea is <i>polyglot markup</i>, which is markup (like HTML is) but designed to work in different dialects consistently.</li><br><li>If you are a developer, and you find yourself writing very specific code like this: … </li>“<li>&lt;*</li>”<li> …  </li>"<li>*&gt;</li>"<li> … (i.e., using &lt;* and *&gt; as built-in strings, as there must be somewhere inside the Mathematica implementation code) please notice those are totally arbitrary strings <i>you</i> devised, and there is no reason why the author<i> — who is not you —</i> using your system will want exactly those codes. At least make them parameterisable so the author can work around clashes you failed to anticipate, or devise other ways to be more flexible.</li><br><li>Read up on other people’s attempts. For example, the reasoning behind the divergence between the different philosophies of HTML, particularly the <i>snapshot</i> based standards of HTML 4, 5, 5.1, etc, and the <i>living</i> standards most of us now user that are continually updating, is both fascinating and a warning.</li><br>This chapter discussed a problem that is more generally called <i>feature interaction</i>. That is, texts have features, but in mixed texts the otherwise desirable features of each text interact in unhelpful and unexpected ways. In general, there are no good solutions to feature interaction, other than taking care to avoid it in the first place and providing mechanisms to help detect it (even block it) <i>before</i> any downstream reader is confused. In healthcare, the problem would be seen as a failure of the problem called <i>interoperability</i>, a potentially lethal problem that undermines the reliability of the mixed texts of patient records.<br>	If we are going to have feature interaction, which we are, we should take all steps to minimise it, and design the amazing powerful things mixed texts can do to eclipse their problems.<br><br><a href="http://www.harold.thimbleby.net/">http://www.harold.thimbleby.net</a><br><hr style="width:10%;"><br><br><h1 id="77990121-B005-42DA-BF92-B8275D51F16B">Jamie

like to discuss a few topics today that are related: <br><br>1) I’m going to start with a discussion of whether the combination of computation with text, as we've known it, poses a danger of placing people into something of a trap, something of a<b> loop in which we lose our future. </b>That's topic number one. <br>2) Topic number two is going to be<b> whether text as we know it is something that we should think of as an eternal central feature of the human condition, or whether it might eventually become less important </b>because other things come along and I will that will be topic number two.<br>3) Topic number three will be about so much spiritual question of whether<b> a degree of mystification of people or text is appropriate going forward</b> in different ways than it has been in the past because of computation. <br><br>So let me start with topic number one. In my peculiar life–and it is really a very strange life that I can hardly believe–one of my roles is as what's called the prime scientist for one of the tech giants, which is Microsoft. And as it happens, our office is the funder and also the distribution channel for a lab called <b>Open AI </b>that you might have heard of that has created probably the highest performing so called AI text service now, which is called GPT. There are different versions of it. I'm sure you're all familiar with this. So it's essentially what our colleagues at Stanford have started to call a ‘foundational model’, a very, very, very large scale model in which all the available text that can be gathered has been gathered and then analyzed in the context of a very, very large computational system. <br>	The result is a service that can simulate a human interlocutor and actually perform in ways that impress people. I would say in general, for instance, it can often do reasonably well at passing high school or college level math classes, which even though there's no representation of math inside it, it's just one example. It can explain jokes, it can do do all sorts of things, reasonably effective translations between languages in some cases. And yet it also has this curious property of suddenly running into., very strange failures where it's obvious that it doesn't in fact have any representation internally of what's being talked about. <br>	So what do we have here? The first thing to say about this type of model? <b>So what does this program actually do? </b>Well, it really addresses the core feature of what we call text, which is sequence. Ultimately, text is a sequence of a number of things where the number of possible sequences is vastly larger than the number of original things that are sequenced. So the things that are sequenced are, well, in some languages the letters, but in all languages, the words. And if all we do is we capture the sequences and we can statistically predict what sequences are more likely than others, we can create a simulacra of language that is remarkably effective. <br>	Now, here on something interesting, which is that <b>it's all about scale or all about the size of the model. </b><br>	If the model is too small, obviously it won't do anything, which is why this kind of illusion of a person inside the computer didn't really start to work until recently because we just couldn't build big enough computers. The ones that we build to accomplish this effect are truly vast. The they're the size of cities. They often are in remote places by rivers that can be used to cool them. They often have their own power sources, hopefully huge renewable, non-carbon emitting ones. There very, very few organizations in the world that can afford to have these models. Microsoft is one, Google is another. The Chinese cluster of companies closely related to the government are another. And there aren’t, there aren't really that many more.<br>	 And the I would contrast this with a hypothetical but impossible infinite model. And this was imagined by Borges in the Infinite library. And of course, that one would be absolutely useless because it would take infinite time or energy to to get to any sequence in it. And so it's effectively none. It's useless. Could it exist? Should it exist? And of course it cannot. <br>	<b>So there's the the effect happens at a large scale, but not too large.</b> And you might ask, do we know exactly what that scale is? Not really. We know the beginning of where it starts to work. We know it'll work even better at a larger scale. But there's some point at which it will start to collapse on itself. We don't know exactly where that peak is now. <br>	But what can we say about this? What have we learned about language? <br>	I think the first thing we can say is that we've learned that most language use is not creative. If we look at it from a global perspective, and we've never had a global perspective before.–we’ve never had a way of looking at everything everybody said–only locally at what somebody published and what somebody said in a conversation and so on. And the Internet doesn't give us everything everybody said, but it does give us everything everybody said on the Internet, which is a lot, especially for younger generations, and also for anything that's been in a library. It's also in the model. And the fact that regurgitating in a sense or interpolating between what has already been said can simulate somebody saying new things, tells us that from a global base on a global basis. There's a lot of redundancy or a lot of a lot of parallel restatement of things because that's the only basis for the solution to work, which perhaps shouldn't be a surprise. <b>And yet it's different to actually have evidence of something rather than surmising it and now we have evidence for the first time of what language as a whole for everyone at once contains,</b> which we didn't have before. <br>	<b>Now what is of interest to me? </b>One thing, one of many things of interest to me is that as we start to use these algorithms, not only just as a novelty to say, ‘Oh, isn't it cute that it can seem like a math student or a psychologist or whatever we might have at simulating?’ It is also of interest to me whether if we start to integrate these types of tools into our own conduct of life, <b>whether we essentially increase the degree of redundancy and lose track of the possibility of creativity.</b> <br>	Now, when I say this, I have to say I'm speaking in a way that strongly violates what we can call tech culture or the usual milieu that I function in, because there's a sort of a I would say a dogma or even an orthodoxy that there is not really such a thing as creativity, which sounds a little mystical, but instead there is some sort of a playing out of large scale recombination. And then eventually this turns into something we think of as creativity very much as Darwinian evolution is very creative, but in any particular instance, it's thought to be sort of random with feedback, and perhaps that's how everything is and that there is no creativity now. <br>	<b>I think there's an important difference between the foundational models that we can build today and say Darwinian evolution for just one example. </b>And that difference is that Darwinian evolution is always about something. There can be some difference of opinion that persists to this day about exactly what it is about. There are some sort of hard nosed adaptation is to say it's only about survival. And then there are others. Including going back to Darwin, who would say, actually, there's sort of a some sort of aesthetic process involved sexual selection and other points of intervention where evolution seems to function a little outside the boundaries of pure survival and have an intrinsic creative quality to it. But at any rate. One can debate those things, but when it's very, very hard and I say this after having debated them for many years, it's very, very hard to come to a definitive conclusion on such a question. <br>	However, the when a program like a foundational program like the GPT generations is not really about a topic external to itself. It's regurgitating original conversations that in most cases were in the original instance about something. So it's a degree removed from being about anything, from being about a topic. <br>	And and so then the question is, is there a sense in which if we rely on these things, for instance, if this type of program is used as our tutor, there are many proposals that they become the universal tutors for kids or even adults in education. If it is used as a criminal detective, if it is used as a physician if it is used as well. Any other task were previously there might have been a human. <br><b>	Is there a danger that it limits what then happens to repeats of what has happened before? </b>Now you'll find many who argue, especially with the tech industry, that we already are seeing creativity, and there are those who think that these things might be conscious inside or something. And once again, very much as with the question of adaptation to human evolution, it's extremely hard to get to an absolute definitive conclusion. However, <b>it is not that hard to design situations to trip up the systems, which is not done that often because people actually want to see them succeed at simulating a human.</b> There's a tremendously strong drive for that, which I'll get to in a second, which which I'm deeply suspicious of. <br>	So I was thinking about a sort of an irony here, which is the tech culture ethos or Silicon Valley ethos, if you like, is very much that<b> the future will be not only different from the present or the past, but so different that it's incomprehensible.</b> <br>	There's often talk of a <b>singularity</b>, which is when everything changes so much because of our advances in computation that we can't even recognize it, that everything transforms, that the whole universe becomes fluid in a new way because of nanotechnology spreading out to the edges of creation, always everywhere or something, something like that. And this happens all the time. All the time. There's a very frequent idea that these artificial intelligence systems will become so effective that they'll solve all of humanity's problems. You'll often hear and I mean very often at like a dinner party that well, if you look at how effective GPT is, we can be assured that a program will solve our climate change problem. We can be assured it'll solve any problems related to infectious disease, it'll solve any problems related to supply of fresh water, etc., etc., etc.. So it's the only problem we have to work on and then that that will solve everything else now. So there's this. Let's leave aside for a second whether that hope is well placed or not or whether it's not, and I think it's not. But well, let's leave that aside. <br>	What I want to note is this sense of the one of the terms is<b> </b>exotropia (?? Jaron?)<b>. </b>And there are many other popular terms within tech culture. <b>This notion that the future is taking off and going into places that are unimaginable, that it's radically creative, radically different. </b>Now, so when I talked about irony, what I mean is <b>we built this thing that would appear to be regurgitated and profoundly nostalgic, profoundly trapped into interpolating things that have already been said. </b>And yet<b> that's in the service of this thing that's supposed to be profoundly future oriented. </b>And I find that extremely interesting. <br>	It reminded me a little bit of the curious effect of Finnegans Wake, which I was rereading recently, where you have this this text that's maximally inventive with as many. Puns, puns, and weird ideas and double entendres and everything per word, as is conceivable in English, I suspect. In the service of depicting this being in this cycle in which nothing is really new, right and so there's this contrast between the nature of the text and what the text is about being almost opposite and I feel like we have a set of opposites like that in Silicon Valley now, but going in in the other direction where <b>we have a regulative, fundamentally uncreative text depicting an infinitely creative future. </b>So it's like the tech culture is the opposite of Finnegans Wake in a funny way now. <b>This concerns me a great deal. </b><br>	The effect is even more apparent maybe not so much in text, but in visual art, where foundational models of visual stuff. So from the same lab we have something called <b>DALL-E,</b> and now there's some other versions of it, like stable diffusion. Some of you might have seen where you can ask for a piece of art where you can say, ‘I would like to have rats flying in a flying saucer in the style of Turner’, and it'll produce this thing and you think, Wow, this things are creative. And yeah, and yet it is fundamentally regurgitated. It can eat, it can input the style of Turner and regurgitate it, but it cannot be a Turner. And also another interesting thing I mentioned failure modes. It's easier to see them in the visual.<br>	If you look at the images that are produced by the visual foundational models like DALL-E, they can be very impressive doing such things as what I just made up. And I mean, not that I've tried that particular one. You never know for sure, but probably if you ask for rats in a flying saucer in the style of Turner, it would do it and it would probably looked at, I don't know. Somebody can try it now if they have it open. But if you ask it to do hands or any creature with hands still tend to not be good, the fingers will be mangled. And <b>the reason why is that hands have structure, </b>they’re not just surface, the hand has to make sense as a functional hand, and interpolating between images of hands tends to mess up that thing. So you tend to have a lot of mangled and weird hands or hands that don't quite work now as is, if you point this out within those who really want to believe in these things as being alive, you'll find the excuses are that people often can't draw hands, which is true. So there might very well be some degree of similarity between what goes on in a human brain and what goes on in these programs. I would say that it is beyond our current horizon of science to say how much similarity, but it does seem reasonable to say that there's a little bit or some amount. I don't think it's total, but I think it's zero. <br>	I think we overstate the similarity when we call the accumulators and set our models neurons. And I think the term artificial intelligence (AI) overstates the similarity, and yet there might be something there, I have to say. <br>Now, this<b> problem I was bringing up of a regurgitate of culture filtered through devices that we can build based on recordings of our past behaviors and communications</b> reminds me a little bit of how many systems that are related to something in the world that might involve representation of it or response to it can become overly narcissistic, if you like, or self self self oriented. So for instance, the immune system can generate autoimmune diseases and economy can become focused on artifacts of itself and become dysfunctional, leading to market failures. Many, many other examples. And so there's there's a if we can think of these things instead of as people as a representation system that's vulnerable to… (system announcement by LiSA: It’s 4 PM) It is 4 p.m…. You can think of this as <b>a system that's vulnerable to becoming trapped in a self reflection rather than being responsive to the thing that it's supposed to be aligned with.</b> And that would be a maybe a less charged way of stating the concern I have about regurgitated culture, but ultimately I want to get to sort of a mystical level of this. <br>	<b>And what I mean by mystical is in a way kind of literal, if mystifying, an aspect of what we're doing instead of attempting not to.</b> So, I have long held. And when I say long, I mean my one of my mentors when I was quite young was Marvin Minsky, who was probably the most important source of the current ideas about artificial intelligence in terms of the images and cultural references that are in use.  <br>	I used to argue with Marvin when I was young, and Marvin, having been one of the original generation of people who believed in artificial intelligence (AI), loved the argument (but people, as is always the case, the subsequent generations become more orthodox and lose their sense of humor and don't have the kind of charm and openness that the original people had, at least in person). So it's my belief that you cannot have perfect ideas. <b>I don't think there's such a thing as a perfectly completed science or perfectly completed cultural theory or perfectly completed mathematics.</b> <b>Any time we apply thought or any time we conceive our world or ourselves–we do so with fractures</b>. That doesn't scare me. I think it's a miracle that we can do anything. The fact that we can even do it partially or imperfectly is fantastic. For some it bothers them that they can't achieve perfection. I don't know why that should bother them. <br>	<b>Here's what I want to propose in the future that we must think about where we place our fractures.</b> And we do have through some miracle, which is the beginning of my mystification. Through some miracle, we have the ability to choose to degree where the fractures will be. And what I would propose is that instead of trying to say, well, here we understand what an intelligence is and we can reproduce it in a machine which then offsets the fracture somewhere else, because then you have the problem of trying to explain, well, where did all this language come in the first place? That's been input into the machine. You end up pushing the fracture out backwards back in time or to some other spot. <br>	I think the better thing is to put the fracture inside the person. In European thought we went through a process of recognizing that you can't prove the existence of God. It's a matter of faith.<b> I think the new thing in response to these models is that we have to start to have a radical, mystical belief in the existence of people as the source material from which these models can be built</b>. And we have to treat ourselves as mystical, transcendent sources, as sort of supernatural, because <b>any other alternative puts us into a regurgitated trap and puts and makes us subservient to creations that will become self resonant and limit our world, and also concentrate wealth and power unsustainably among the nerds who run the models.</b><br>I only got to one of the three things I was going to talk about, but there you go.<br><br><h3 id="97844827-D046-432B-ABCB-AB83D2207118">Q&amp;A</h3><br><br><b>Frode Hegland: </b>I'd love to hear a little bit more about what you mean by <b>fracture.</b> Thank you.<br><b>Jaron Lanier: </b>By fracture, I mean the limits to the ability to make a consistent and complete and perfect assessment of oneself or one's world. In mathematics, we have many such fracture fractures, the most famous maybe being girdles theorem, but this is also true everywhere. If you look in in the sciences, in physics, you can push, push, push, push back to, I don't know, the big Bang or something, but there's always some kind of an artifice that you have to make up at the edges of what you can understand and you can push it back, but not infinitely. And that's formal. I mean, there's just no there's never going to be an absolutely complete, fully rounded circle, closed physics. It can get better and better, but not perfect. Similarly, I think our understanding of text. It can become deeper and deeper. But I think ultimately, as I say, there's always going to be a bit of a mystery about how this thing works at all. We can offset that mystery to something other than text, but we can't offset entirely because we can't make a completely consistent universal view. So I'm proposing that we position the fracture and the person in order to mystify the person and make us sort of special and supernatural rather than machines or any other artifice.<br><br><b>Fabien Benetou: </b>Thank you.  So I'm wondering if one way to put it, is that the trap? I mean,<b> is it a genuine trap in the sense that we all lose agency or that the loss of agency is just temporary, or is it just for some of us or maybe we actually properly earn agency?</b><br><b>Jaron Lanier: </b>Yeah, well, you know, this was a theoretical question 20 years ago that I used to talk about and write about quite a lot and. If anybody is interested in looking at my early concerns about it. There are some essays from the nineties. One is called ‘Half the Manifesto†’, I think, and the other one's called Agents of Alienation†. So that was when it was purely theoretical. But at this point it's done, it's empirical. <br>	So the, the text management programs that we call artificial intelligence are overwhelmingly used for the manipulation of humans now and not for any discernible productive purpose. And this is, of course, the problem with the social media companies and what we've seen. The answer is not 100% one thing or another thing. It's a statistical distribution. <b>It's definitely the case that these things have reduced agency among people.</b> For instance, they've reduced rationality and increased mental disease, I would say in people as a whole, and this has been studied very widely. They've decreased the quality of political discourse very widely, and this is also been studied. And so you see a statistical degradation of what I would call sensible autonomy in people when they are exposed to the algorithms thus far empirically. Now, as with, it's important to understand that. There might be a way of in fact, I think there probably is a way of incorporating these algorithms into life that doesn't have this effect. And it's not the algorithms per se, it's the algorithms combined with an economic incentive because of stupid business models, the so-called this is the whole thing. Anybody who wants to read this, I've written about it a lot, obviously so. And it's also stupid philosophy. So it's bad economics. Bad philosophy combined with the algorithms that make the algorithms destructive of human autonomy, if you like, and dignity. I think the algorithms actually can be useful, and there's no reason for them not to be. But it requires a change in philosophy and economics.<br><br><b>Max Drake: </b>Hi. Max Drake here. I really like what you were saying about <b>mysticism.</b> And I think as someone who's worked a lot with GPT three so far and seen Internet responses to it, I can definitely imagine a kind of like a dueling. I just the bottle itself, kind of. Oh, sorry to cut out it. Kind of. Yeah, so I can imagine. Yeah, there's like the possibility of some other kind of mysticism or merging that is more nefarious in places, the model itself as kind of the source of that. And I was wondering, is that what you see as a kind of like is that similar to. Is that what we need to fight against or is what's your imaginary for?<br><b>Jaron Lanier: </b>You know, right now people roughly speaking, there's two ways of interacting with big models online. One of them is where the model is kind of intrinsic to the interaction and the other one where is where it's explicit and you know about it. So, so far with releases like GPT people, no, they're interacting with GPT, that's the whole point. And, and, and so if the person is led in on the joke, so to speak, if there's an awareness of what's going on, then I think then what you were calling the nefarious nature of it is greatly reduced. And so and in fact it's in those terms. So one of the problems that a lot of technical culture is formed when people are, especially people with any technical skill or interest, are interacting with these things. And in that case, they're cute. I mean, it's not nefarious, but then when the transition happens is when people are using a social media system or anything that has recommendations or anything that constructs an experience feed. And instead of being said, well, here's the model, here's how you can tweak it, here's how you can play with it. It's just intrinsic to their experience. And in that case, it becomes sneaky and very subject, in fact explicitly subject to corruption, because the whole point is that third, third parties are paying in an attempt to control the attention and manipulate the people who are using it. And that's all the Facebook or media companies do that. TikTok does it as an example now, and they're all they're all doing that. And that is that is where the damage comes in. It's when people are having experience created by algorithms that you start to see degradation of human decency and and intelligence. And it happens so far universally.<br><br><b>Andreea Ion Cojocaru: </b>I would be interested to know where you personally, what you personally see as <b>the main source of mysticism or potential mysticism inside people.</b> Are you are you primarily looking at consciousness or some of those things like you personally?<br><b>Jaron Lanier: </b>Sure. Well. There has been a strong wind of sort of anti consciousness acknowledgement in technical culture for decades and. This. I, I disagree with with that tendency. The the argument is something like we used to think the earth was the center of the universe, and now we should recognize that our consciousness is at the center of anything and we're not special and all that. And at first it seems kind of humble and kind of in the line of the of the Enlightenment. But I think actually all it does is it forces the mysticism somewhere else. And for instance, people who talk about AI algorithms and believe in that they're conscious or something will never stop sprinkling magic dust on the algorithms. Oh, it's so magical. It's come alive. But then they'll say for people, Oh no, these people are just, you know, it's a kind of an inconsistent thing. Like what you're doing is you're you're moving the magic dust from people to the machine. But the machine is owned by some company. And it's politically and economically a terrible idea, but it's also just philosophically sloppy. And I just think we should admit that we can't get rid of magic dust and might as well put it on the person. There are many, many angles on this, and I've been in the consciousness arguments for many years, but. I would say consciousness is the one thing that cannot be reduced if it's an illusion. And we should treat it as a uniquely efficient place to put our themes.<br>	You know, it's like the most sensible place. And so consciousness is some kind of impure. It's some kind of a channel that's not empirical, it's something else. I don't think you can prove it. I used to sometimes argue with people who were skeptical of it, like Daniel Dennett, that the only way you can. There are some people who are professional philosophers who claim not to be conscious, and maybe you can believe them. But in general, one should have the faith that other people are conscious, and maybe that's the more appropriate and useful contemporary faith instead of faith in God. It's similar, actually, but it's slightly different. It's just. And then the other question I would ask is, if we're going to create a society that's run by algorithms, if we don't elevate people in some mystical or supernatural way, how can it serve people if it's all just information components, why doesn't it just devolve to whoever owns the computer and serving them? I don't see any other way unless you make people special and you see that in the early Enlightenment documents about democracy and society, You see this recognition that you have to just treat people special and there's no ultimate logical justification. There's a there's a pragmatic reason, given a set of opposing beliefs that can't be resolved through logical competition, that you have to become pragmatic. And weirdly, we have come to a point where mysticism is the most pragmatic choice, as well as, I believe the most philosophically gracious one.<br><br><b>Vint Cerf: </b>Hi, Jaron. It's so good to see you. Thank you so much. So it's been I'm sorry you couldn't be here in person. Actually, this isn't the question. It's an observation, as usual, listening to you as an intellectual romp and several new phrases have occurred to me as I listen. The first one is stochastic retrieval, which is basically what a lot of these things do. Second, casual retrieval, which is what happens when you have the dialogue. And I really like your idea of the universal computer. These things know more than we do, although they also know false things as well as true things. And that's a problem we have to deal with. And the last point is that since this is really recreating the already existing dialogue, so to speak, human discourse, this could be used to create a dialogue with a dead person. And that suggests that another label for these is <b>rhetorical zombie.</b><br><b>Jaron Lanier: </b>Let us be clear about the power relationship here. And so nice to see you. I what? This tendency to want to revive the dead using algorithms is very, very widespread in tech culture. And I. I think. We should treat it as an evil. I understand there could be some circumstances where it could have utility and there are often scenarios discussed where, oh, I don't know, some kid has a traumatic loss of a parent. I did when I was when I was young, by the way. I lost my mother when I was young. And then this notion that maybe it could be therapeutic. I think we should. Adopt. It's kind of interesting looking at the Islamic resistance to representing people as images that that has been traditional. Perhaps I'm not proposing that we adopt that. And yet I think looking at the impulse in its source is instructive and worthwhile. I, I think there's a terrible danger in telling a kid that the parent can be represented in code. I think demystifying the parent, turning the parent into something that's a portion of a database or an algorithm demystifying the parent will inevitably instead mystify the computer or whoever provides the service or something. There's no way to remove mystification because there's no way to have a complete point of view. So the inevitable conclusion of simulating a dead person is to subsume that person into somebody else's scheme. Just given how politics and economics work. And so I think we should treat it as an evil and I would like to see it become treated as a moral outrage, possibly even illegal in some circumstances. I really do feel that this is a road to civilizational ruin. Few agree with me, but I think more will come to see the merit in this concern.<br><hr style="width:10%;"><br><br><h1 id="E090134C-3F2B-4AA0-89A9-DB4D467F9E92">Jim Strahorn</h1><br><br><center><h2 id="2C9069DE-9AA7-45E5-8E05-C0E25315EA4D">The Future of ...

Yet something feels wrong about 2D displays in a 3D world, or is it specifically 2D monitors that seem wrong?<br>	Pursuing this line of thought, no doubt using some common ideas: Our computer desktop interfaces have long been a quasi-virtual world in 2D (pretending to be shallow 3D), with virtual paper, calendars, buttons and other objects. But in a 3D VR world the natural step is to set these objects free, showing documents and tools out in the world not on a monitor. So why are there apps to show 2D monitors in VR - is it just a temporary step to get existing apps running? We could ‘remove the bezels’ and make windows or their contents into 2D objects: but that seems wrong because 2D objects in 3D are physically impossible, and they would also miss a big opportunity. <br><br>	So we could propose a strict VR design rule:<br><b>	2D is shallow, 3D is deep: objects </b><b><i>must</i></b><b> use the 3rd dimension.</b><br><br>By following this rule, 2D monitors would be banished from VR so that what they show, such as stacks of paper, would be forced to become 3D and out in the world. Or maybe the 3D objects could be inside a <b>3D window: </b>what would that be like, and why have it? Perhaps a glass or wireframe box just like a museum display case - call it a <b>window box</b> - with edges that you can see and pull to change the size in 3 directions. Indeed the <i>only</i> reason our current displays are 2D is technological. If they could easily display depth like a hologram we’d use that for everything: for buttons, documents and people on Zoom calls, and stacked windows would cast real shadows not fake ones. A holographic display is just easier to make in VR. Of course, some media like video aren’t yet easy to show in 3D, but they could be simulated (maybe in shallow 3D) for now.<br>	And why have an object trapped inside a window box at all? The box would be a <i>view</i>, always showing an object (or part of a large object) residing in <b>another space</b>. That space could be another room, maybe to see someone you’re talking to; but for a large document it could be a space containing just the document, or maybe a collection of documents you’re working on, arranged in various possible ways. You’d be able to scroll and zoom what the box shows you, much like a 2D window. This is often easier than walking around actual large documents in your room, let alone comparing large documents side by side, or having to use old 3D compressed formats like Julius Caesar’s invention, the ‘book’. In VR, space will still be at a premium: you may not want to share your room with everything and everyone you’re working with, or join a crowd of thousands to watch a presentation in a lecture theatre. Instead of visiting an office, many would prefer a home office where they can arrange window boxes (as we do 2D windows now). <br>	If window boxes sound much like existing windows, they’re less so when it comes to sharing objects. Let’s say you can see a document or whiteboard in a window box, and other people in other rooms can also see it via their own window boxes. To edit, you’d just reach into the box, grab a pen inside and scribble away. The other people could do the same, and maybe the physics could allow you to interact with them, such as by handing each other tools inside the box. The glass could be absent when the contents are editable, or present to keep you out.<br>	It could be useful to actually visit the space where a document resides, especially if it’s in a larger collection. Normally you’d edit the document from your room via a window box, but sometimes <b>you could</b> <b>jump in</b> to wander around the collection itself. Proposals for virtual libraries (and the like) often assume documents are available in your workroom, or in a special document space, not both. But we can literally have the best of both worlds.<br><br><h3 id="7351BA58-C1B5-480B-B57D-F3E7F910195E">Conclusion</h3><br><br>	Objects in VR should be treated as real: actually there, full-sized and complete. But a window box surrounding a document or a person’s head would show it’s really part of a different space, isn’t necessarily the same size as the box, and other people (in other spaces) can view and edit it too.<br>	This improves on the 2D windows of the existing quasi-VR desktop interface, which aren’t just missing a dimension, but have a subtle flaw. They don’t make a clear distinction between objects which are <i>real in the desktop world</i> (here and accessible by you alone) and those which are <i>virtual in the desktop world</i> (elsewhere and accessible by others).<br><h1 id="8A142827-03C1-4912-BCF9-66D2925D3D71">Kalev Hannes Leetaru</h1><br><br><center><h2 id="8CF5C0A6-9366-450B-8FD0-52EFA00F99E7">Seeing Through Others’ Eyes:</h2><br><h2 id="8CF5C0A6-9366-450B-8FD0-52EFA00F99E7">Reimagining How We Experience The News</h2><br></center><br>Two decades ago, I built a CAVE virtual reality application called ShadowLight. Users stepped into the 10x10x10’ cube of the CAVE, donned their VR glasses and picked up a 6DOF tracked game controller that allowed them to quite literally “draw in space” all around them. ShadowLight enabled both organic (freeform artistic drawing) and architectural (constrained CAD-like geometry) creation by reaching out in space and physically drawing with one’s hands, creating entire worlds out of thin air. The ability to create in physical space, yet selectively disregard gravity, fundamentally altered the creation process. Rather than create structures from the bottom up, designers suddenly created at will, creating forms and spaces at random in space and then forming the rest of the world around them.<br>	Uniquely, ShadowLight allowed the embedding of complete dynamic miniature worlds within that creative space, from physics-governed objects to connections to the outside world where objects and entire subworlds could be remote controlled or evolve based on the real world. Traditional desktop-designed CAD and artistic objects could be added, alongside realtime capture data from the real world, blending and bending the very concept of “reality.” The real world could be brought inside in realtime. Historical events could be replayed. Simulations of real and fantasy worlds and objects could play out.<br>	All of this played out in the same shared virtual space that a designer could create within, finding inspiration in ways never before possible. This single application was used by architects, designers, artists, engineers, planners and even middle school students, necessitating an interface that could be used intuitively by all. I personally spent two entire weeks living exclusively within this virtual world non-stop as an experiential experiment. One of the greatest lessons it taught was the power that comes from connecting the digital and physical worlds and using them to see the world through others’ eyes.<br>	What does it mean to experience and preserve the world to allow others to see a place, event or moment in time through one’s eyes? My undergraduate thesis involved capturing more than a quarter-million photographs of the University of Illinois campus over the seasons, including its major events, and digitizing tens of thousands of pages of books, pamphlets, letters, maps, proceedings and documents spanning more than a century and a half, the majority of which had never before been available online, together with writing the histories of more than 300 buildings and spaces and hundreds upon hundreds of objects and events, weaving all of it into a massive digital experience that tells the story of the university’s evolution over the years. It remains, twenty years later, the definitive digital guide to the institution’s physical history and source materials.<br>	Most importantly, this history tells the story not of the lives of famous people, but of the buildings and spaces that define the experience of those who have attended or worked at the institution over the past century and a half. In other words, it inverts the idea of how we tell the story of our institutions. The average university student can’t rattle off the names of the deans and department heads of their college, but they know the buildings they pass by and through each day. By telling the story of the university’s history through its buildings and spaces, the narratives that emerge connect with today’s students in a way that traditional histories cannot.<br>	One again, traditional concepts are reimagined in a way only the digital world makes possible.<br>	Following in this tradition, a decade ago I pondered the question of just what defines the concept of a “book.”<br>	In our earliest years of life, books are visual-first mediums, filled with pictures and few words. In short order, however, pictures give way to words as we progress through school and our very concept of what defines a “book” becomes built upon words in place of images. Indeed, as the world of libraries has entered the digital era, book digitization has focused for the past half-century on capturing the text on the pages and discarding the imagery that appears alongside. Even the physical scanning processes used to digitize books have often used imaging sensors, lighting, processing and storage workflows optimized for text, at the degradation of images, to the point that bitonal black and white scans dominate many collections.<br>	What would happen if we returned to the books of our childhoods and reimagined books as collections of images, rather than of words? Of libraries not merely as archives of knowledge, but as the greatest distributed art gallery ever created? What untold treasures of artistic creation and historical record lay in wait in the world’s books to be discovered? The end result involved extracting 12 million images from over 600 million digitized public domain book pages dating back 500 years from over 1,000 libraries worldwide and making them all browsable and even searchable by connecting each image with its caption or surrounding text, book metadata and other images within the same work. While the underlying books had been available online for years, these 12 million images had been scattered and buried deeply within their half-billion pages, secluded and invisible among their hundreds of billions of words. By extracting them from that text, mobilizing them and placing them front-and-center in their own right, half a millennia of images were now accessible and discoverable on their own terms, reintroducing them to a new era of audiences.<br>	Once again, the digital world afforded the power to reimagine the most mundane aspects of our informational lives to transform them into something extraordinary.<br>	Yet even this endeavor still treated books as closed end-to-end narratives written once and read unaltered for eternity. Could a book be more?<br>	What precisely is a “book?” Is a Choose Your Own Adventure a book? Is Wikipedia a community-contributed live-edited book? Is social media a book? Is a game or virtual reality experience a book? What if we stopped thinking of “books” in terms of physical objects printed once and distributed unaltered and began to think in the broader terms of the collection and compilation of information?<br>	The digital world is in essence a globally distributed live-edited ephemeral compilation of information, narratives, beliefs and emotions encompassing the planet – a form of book. That book’s authors represent just a fraction of the world’s communities, narratives and languages and its pages are unevenly ephemeral, with some lasting decades while others perish within moments of being written. Within its pages lay traces of the world beyond its reach. Unlike the two-dimensional world of the printed book, this digital world spans every modality, from video, audio, still imagery and text to the interactive world of code and the experiential virtual worlds they enable.  <br>	What if we thought of the world’s news media as a form of live-edited live-streaming “book” encompassing global narratives and events? How might we make this live archive of human society accessible for scholarly and journalistic understanding?<br>	The informational world is filled with scholars writing and lecturing, but all those ideas are for naught if they never become reality. Rather than talk about how the world should be, today’s digital world gives us the power to create those visions, to bring them to reality.<br>	It is not enough to merely archive and preserve the digital world. It isn’t helpful to say years later that buried within petabytes of data in a digital archive were the earliest warning signs of an impending pandemic or the answer to the world’s most pressing questions. For such archives to be useful, they must combine human and machine interfaces to transform petabytes of data into actionable insights and understandings of the world. Can the sentiment of news predict wars, its undercurrents yield the earliest glimmers of tomorrow’s pandemics, its cycles forecast the future to come?<br>	Importantly, news is multimodal, spanning video, still imagery, the spoken word and text in all the world’s languages. Historically each of these modalities and languages were treated individually, but the narratives that govern our understanding of the world around us do not. All of these modalities and representations interplay organically in the form of societal narratives and inorganically in the form of influence and amplified falsehoods. <br>	AI is increasingly used to process the firehoses of content that both define the digital world and defy human attempts to make sense of it. But, what does it mean for AI to “see” the world and transcribe it into codified form? This spans not merely the ontological lenses such approaches enforce, but the very question of quantifying a fundamentally qualitative world, stripping away representation, framing and ascetics to codify. What does it mean to distill an image of government security forces using violence to suppress their own citizenry into a machine summary of “police, protesters, violence”?  As we explore how best to teach machines how to “see” a world made of news, we learn too how to help make that world more accessible to those with different abilities in the visual-first realm of VR.<br>	How do we teach journalists and scholars how to use these new analytic lenses? For more than six decades we have taught researchers and, in turn, society itself, how to think in terms of the humble keyword. From their earliest years, children the world over living in digitized societies learn to condense their most complex and nuanced questions underpinning every corner of their lives into a sequence of simplistic keywords to be typed into a search engine.<br>	What will it take to teach future generations how to use the post-keyword world of search?<br>	What does it mean to “visually” search television news? What are the dimensions that best define how we see the news and the information it conveys? How do the universe of objects, activities, landmarks, onscreen text, colors, shapes, textures, visual relationships come together to form an understandable visual narrative? How do we make all of that searchable in a way that preserves not merely the binary existence of individual labels, but the complex and interdependent relationships amongst them? Most importantly, how do we teach researchers and society at large how to think in terms of the fundamentally new metaphors and mindsets required to engage with these new richly condensed representations that codify that which is inherently qualitative and whose representation depends on so heavily on its realtime interpretation through the lived experience and context of the viewer?<br>	The global open data GDELT Project represents precisely such a firehose over planet earth. What does it mean to “see” the world as a firehose of events, narratives and emotions spanning video, imagery, audio and text in all the world’s written, spoken and visual languages? If the coming “metaverse” is to be a unification of infinite discrete virtual worlds, GDELT represents the “metaverse” of the global journalism landscape, constructing a singular unified realtime digital image of planet earth that bridges our fractured and divided societies into a single “news metaverse.” The challenges of constructing a singular representation that spans the infinite richness of our diverse world resists singular definitions, necessitating the construction of infinite immense intrinsically interconnected graphs that represent the world in all its infinite localized representations and connecting them, allowing inquiry that spans this representational continuum of preciseness to unification. What constitutes a “feast” or “happiness” across the world? <br>	VR is a visually-centered medium that has been historically dominated by Western visual storytelling. Yet, the web and social media have their roots in textual representation that is increasingly globalized. GDELT’s collaboration with the Internet Archive’s Television News Archive spanning 50 countries over 20 years captures the unprecedented possibilities to understand how visual representation and narrative traditions across the world have adapted to the shared medium of television news. All across the world, the medium’s constraints are the same, so how have the societies of the world adapted their storytelling traditions to it? These insights can tell us much about how societies will adapt their different visual languages into VR.<br>	Television news across the world is both highly similar and incredibly different. Some channels tell the news primarily through newsreaders in studios, others rely more heavily on first person reporting from the field and still others tell the news largely through political and religious leaders, panel discussions and interviews with ordinary citizens. Some channels focus on hard news, others on commentary and some use news primarily to promote government and cultural narratives. Some countries rely on commercial advertising to support television news, while others focus more heavily on music, cultural programming, public service announcements, government statements or religious content between segments. Studio environs range from staid to ornate to technicolor vibrance. Even presentation styles vary from speakers primarily facing the camera to primarily looking offscreen. All of these differences and similarities will once more play out in the coming metaverse, with television news having much to teach us as to the forms the metaverse will take.<br>	What are some of the challenges our metaverse future will hold?<br><br><h3 id="5DD4434D-3B5D-4D16-985A-8BCC75BA33C9">Globalization</h3><br><br>We tend to live within the confines of our own geographic, linguistic and cultural affinities. In the digital world, machine translation and global accessibility make it possible to achieve a transcendent consciousness that allows us to absorb the world around us. When GDELT first launched its Translingual initiative 8 years ago, there was widespread rejection within the social sciences of the need to look beyond English and the Western world to understand the rich diversity of the world’s societies. The idea that Western media was merely an internalized and highly biased lens that shaped awareness and understanding of the world was largely rejected through much of the social sciences in favor of the idea that the informational landscape was abjectly neutral and captured all “worth” reporting upon, without an understanding of the values and biases encoded in that concept of “worth.” As the world has become ever more globalized, there is growing recognition of the need for a more holistic and globalized understanding of the world.<br><br><h3 id="EE34A615-6165-4123-A797-F464DF5321EB">From Firehose To Awareness</h3><br><br>How does one take this realtime digital proxy of the planet and use it to understand the conflicting chaotic cacophony that is our global world? The combination of machines sifting through trillions of datapoints in realtime to identify the anomalies that are the earliest glimmers of tomorrow’s biggest stories and working with humans to contextualize and understand their importance and that actions that must be taken in response represents fundamental new challenges in both technology and mindsets.<br><br><h3 id="5B1F014A-820A-4678-83E4-72FFDBAFA67A">Falsehoods</h3><br><br>Much like its physical predecessors, the digital world is filled with falsehoods. Its global reach and cheapness of distribution has dramatically increased the ability of falsehoods to span the globe, while the global competition of the information space means even the world’s mainstream traditional media finds itself in a race towards negativity, sensationalism and clickbait as its distribution is increasingly controlled by social media gatekeepers. The ability of such falsehoods to transcend the digital sphere to wreak real-world havoc and violence is reinforced each day. Yet in a digital world that spans the world’s rich diversity of societies, who defines what is “truth” and “acceptable” in a globalized world with very different understandings? How will that work in a future metaverse?<br><br><h3 id="3DC23841-8458-4BE0-9304-1D4C0B932959">Our Ever-Evolving Language</h3><br><br>All language models represent snapshots in time, yet the world is fluid. Sentiment dictionaries capture “cool” as “cold” or “extra” as positive. Words, images, even emojis are constantly redefined and taken ownership of by new generations and communities, their meanings fluid and ever-changing. Machine translation models today still fail to properly translate pandemic-related terms that did not exist when their massive models were trained and their size, scale and brittleness makes them difficult to update. The digital world is perhaps the world’s largest global observatory for changing written and visual language throughout the world. We can see the emergence, decline, evolution and transcendence of language in all its forms evolving across time and space. Much as the web today encapsulates the detritus of decades of society, what will the VR world look like as the ever-changing landscape of our visual narratives and metaphors must suddenly be accounted for, building in aggregate and uneven ephemeral layers over years?<br><br><h3 id="44DA33D9-4D5E-4922-9773-7D61D81DA5B1">Preservation</h3><br><br>What does it mean to “preserve” the world’s news media? The balkanization, geotargeting, personalization, ephemeral perpetual editing and recontextualization of the news means it is not sufficient merely to snapshot a piece of news and associate it with a URL or DOI. We must understand the entire context of its technical acquisition and the temporal, geographic, social and personalized context in which it was seen and understood. Media scholarship requires different understandings of provenance and precision that differ from the opportunistic capture of traditional digital archival. This reflects the same challenges that will eventually confront the VR space. <br><br><h3 id="80456EBE-0571-4C66-B0F7-8C000D8B59D9">Interface</h3><br><br>More than a decade of collaborations with the Internet Archive’s Television News Archive has reinforced the centrality of interface to making archives useful. How something as simple as transforming linear video into a thumbnail grid can fundamentally change how we interact with it, opening the door to answering a wealth of previously impossible questions. Most importantly, however, the Visual Explorer suggests a coming confrontation between the richness of the unstructured VR space and the need to sample it into a discrete “skimmable” form. Video archives today are experienced as pointers into vast libraries: URLs that take visitors to individual videos or sections within them. There is no way to rapidly visually skim them to, for example, inventory particular metaphors or narratives. Prior to the Visual Explorer, there was no way to scan the linear form of Russian state television for depictions of nuclear blasts, appearances of maps, repurposing of Western media or the emotion of its framing. How might a rich and complex coming virtual world be similarly rendered “skimmable” and what does it even mean to “skim” an experiential reality?<br><h3 id="4D828F5D-584B-457A-9611-F43485154034">Merging Human &amp; Machine Intelligence</h3><br><br>The Visual Explorer reminds us that machines alone aren’t capable of the complex deep nuanced reasoning that lies at the heart of many of our most important journalistic and scholarly questions. Yet, no human could pour over a petascale video archive of millions of broadcasts. We need tools that merge our respective capabilities. What might that look like in the coming metaverse?<br><br><h3 id="00FEF3E0-F2AC-4D94-BE81-9FFCAEAAFF0E">Search</h3><br><br>What does it look like to “search” television news? What might it look like to “search” virtual reality? The reduction of its infinite richness to a common representational ontology in a metaverse must permit uniform search across virtual worlds with disjoint conceptions even of common objects, such as what “shoes” are, much as the globalized search of GDELT requires infinite interconnected contextualized knowledge graphs that represent the complete range of representations and experiences of a given concept. Even with the written word, how does one search for a concept that is precisely defined in the searcher’s language, but has no equivalent concept in other languages? <br><br><h3 id="F1ABC984-83D3-4EBD-B149-75A93A9FEB32">Synthesis</h3><br><br>As large neural models produce increasingly humanlike text and imagery, our understanding of what it means to communicate and the linkage of text to image, the written and visual languages, is increasingly of focus. Today we can perform reverse image search to track all of these news images across the open web and cluster news to see how the same story is portrayed in different language and the captions of images. What will that look like in our virtual future, especially as machines increasingly can generate, rather than merely analyze information? As machines become increasingly adept at creating novel imagery, text, audio and video, what does machine “creation” look like in the virtual world? Merely the creation of code that defines a world, much as the creation of game assets and experiences? Or something entirely new that we cannot yet imagine?<br><br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><h3 id="577E889B-A954-409D-B879-B75354ABB1E8">Dimensionality</h3><br><br>News exists in spatial, temporal, cultural, cognitive and myriad other dimensions at once. It is created in a location, time and context, intended for other locations, times and contexts and consumed at yet other locations, times and contexts. An ordinary news article a year ago proclaiming the impossibility of war in Europe would have fallen into the obscurity of the ubiquitousness of its argument in the context of the world of that moment. This mundane article suddenly becomes extraordinary when rediscovered in the world of a year later. When we map the news in time, space, context and the myriad other lenses through which we understand information, we force that information to undergo countless transformative processes to project it from the moment of its creation to the moment in which we are attempting to understand it. This can be something as simple as representing a news event on a map in a geographic form with which it does not align, such using a city-centroid dot to represent a geocoded news article or a Place-coded tweet as a placeholder for a vastly finer, but inaccessible, geographic resolution. Or wondering aloud why an article was so widely ignored at the time when we understand its vast significance given hindsight.<br><br><h3 id="49A568A5-8B21-405C-9DB8-C7FAFCA7EF38">Interpretation &amp; Emotion</h3><br><br>News is not just the conveyance of fact. It conveys emotion: of the author, of those being described and that which it creates within the reader. Yet, emotion is prefaced on context, community membership and lived experience, creating contradictions and complexities in the conveyance of emotion and how it should be understood. Such concepts are even more complex in time of conflict, such as wartime coverage lauding destruction and death as positive concepts due to their wartime utility. How is a sentiment analysis tool to adequately codify the emotion of a reader from a century ago when its underlying models were constructed based on readership and language use today? Few sentiment efforts focus on historical language use, given the field’s fixation on commercial deployments based upon modern language use. Moreover, sentiment models assume a single “truth” to the emotional conveyance of a given text, which belies the intensely personal and contextual notion of emotion.<br><br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><h3 id="307413AC-DCF3-445D-A101-7DD75D82F951">Transformation</h3><br><br>News is intended for human consumption through well-defined modalities of television, radio, earphones, screens, paper. How do we transform such material for machine consumption through the digital world? Those same complexities confront our coming digital world creators in how to transform the world to VR into forms understandable by machines. Most importantly, in place of today’s codified lenses through which machines understand the world, what might a machine version of qualitative understanding look like? In place of today’s petabytes of JSON annotations, how might tomorrow’s AI models transform information into insights?<br><br><h3 id="025D2A93-1230-4FBB-AA0C-9EB965D9B41A">Representation</h3><br><br>News is an imperfect and highly biased representation of the real world upon which entire fields of study are based to understand how those representative failures and biases influence both our understanding of the world and the functioning of society. How will tomorrow’s metaverse address such issues?<br><br>In the end, the coming future brings with it not just a new world of human and machine interaction and new experiential mediums like VR, but reflecting back on the power of thinking differently about the information landscape, the future will usher in myriad new reimaginations of just what a “book” is and our ability to bring all of these coming innovations together to see the world through others’ eyes in entirely new ways never before imaginable. <br><br><h1 id="22BDDCE3-8770-47B4-B049-B2788D300E13">Ken Perlin</h1><br><br><center><h2 id="96920730-486C-492B-948A-A34455CE2A26">Symposium Closing Keynote: Experiential Computing and the Future of Text</h2><br></center><br>A decade from now, smart-glasses, and the networked infrastructure that will make them possible, will fundamentally alter everything from how children learn to how work is conducted to the meaning of shared public spaces. The reductive emojis of today's smart phones will give way to richer means of expression. It is hard to fully anticipate the impact of such a profound change on the nature of text, but we can make a few predictions.<br>	Perhaps the most fundamental long term change may be that text, and in fact language itself, will evolve to work together with physical gesture, because gestures will be able to make things happen in our shared computer-mediated physical space. The greatest agents of this change will be small children, because children seven years of age and younger are actually the creators of natural language. Once this technology is in their hands, they will evolve the uses and meaning of text in new and powerful ways that we can hardly imagine.<br><br><h3 id="E51727A3-DE05-49D1-802A-8D565910A589">Presentation</h3><br><br><center><img id="3E4A62BD-E9D5-4654-A511-1833B0B2A861" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/2B304A75-E34D-4510-9B23-E4CEB04DA24C.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br><b>Ken Perlin: </b>So this is talk of experiential computing and the future of text. <br>	So my first experience is virtual reality. Probably. I've been thinking about this probably happened when I was probably about six years old, and our neighbor who was a salesman, gave my brother and myself a set of. Plastic toy dinosaurs. And I would spend hours and hours and hours taking them on stories and adventures and making up all kinds of narratives with my dinosaurs. And then when I was probably about ten or 11, I discovered Harold and his purple crayon <a href="http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=IxSwswEACAAJ">(Crockett, 2018)</a>. And that inspired me to think that, Oh, you can actually just create whatever worlds you want. <br><center><img id="9B72C166-BD8F-458F-AE18-5AB89E25D52B" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/44A75F63-EE5C-4879-AE5C-A3E0F3E64BEC.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br>And then when I was 16, I saw Fantasia, and then that completely expanded my consciousness and I said, ‘That's what I want to do when I grow up!’. And in fact their dinosaurs moved.<br><br><center><img id="5839D528-D59F-4FD3-A74B-3B907A43BFC6" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/DA786677-4464-4028-8008-64508AB8B04F.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br>And then about five years after that, I worked on the movie Tron, and I realized that working with computer graphics in 1981 was not the same as what I had seen in nine made in 1940 with Fantasia. <br><center><img id="C6C0F85F-552A-43C3-8D49-716D76C41010" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/69E40CCD-C423-4670-A3B7-E272B9CB8B39.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br>So I started developing techniques to try to make computer graphics more interesting. I developed procedural techniques, what are now called compute shaders, the idea of running a complete program at every pixel, and that combined text and art in interesting new ways. <br><br><center><img id="C82925B5-8C02-4AD9-8083-98E7DEBE7CB5" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/45C01038-1BEB-433B-A2B9-D77D6220D14B.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br>And then eventually those techniques made their way to making even better dinosaurs.

I fled industry for the safety of academia. I developed the first Zoomable interfaces, which is apparently become a thing. <br><br><center><img id="18478979-25C1-4F93-8BF0-AE5128C1BC2E" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/B49C1913-D1CE-41A9-B9B7-FDE3924B37FC.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br>I did all sorts of crazy experiments, like I discovered playing with 3D printing. So I said, How could you print four dimensions? In fact, how could you print five dimensions? So this is a a tumbling hypercube. So I guess that's four dimensions plus one projected down to four, and it's a five dimensional object. <br><br><center><img id="67C65467-F959-4597-A2A2-AB27293CBEC2" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/39A6C29F-17C2-474D-AA32-3C9A839ABB27.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br>And then eventually, I founded a lab that was specifically about trying to look at what would be everyone's shared experience of the future<b> (NYU’s Future Reality Lab)</b>. I was reacting to the fact that VR is a thing where you put on this headset and you go off into your own space and you're disconnected from the physical world around you and the people in the same room. <br>	This reiterates the historical experience of Edison's kinetic scope, which really didn't catch on, it wasn't until the Lumiere brothers put everybody in a big room with other human beings that movies became the dominant medium the early 20th century. <b>It's because people really like to gather with each other. </b>It's instinctive. It's part of our survival as a species. <br><b>	We did a whole bunch of experiments at NYU i</b>n which we put people in the same physical room in shared virtual worlds. Probably our biggest was in 2018, which we first showed at SIGGRAPH and then at the Tribeca Film Festival. We had 30 something people experience the same virtual theater piece together, but the people could all see each other and hear each other as avatars. And we showed that to several thousand people at SIGGRAPH and then 1000 more people in Vancouver. And the idea was to see what could you have as a VR experience that was socially shared. So it could be experienced eventually by hundreds of millions of people. <br><br><center><img id="DFA065AD-60CE-4EBF-A5F5-0E1324E7A42D" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/54E1D9E6-6C81-4F01-ADE8-AAEFC1CA17C6.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br>Well, meanwhile, in 2006, I had read Rainbows End <a href="http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=AiEscCXu7TIC">(Vernor, 2011)</a>, a science fiction story that influenced me very deeply.

We just think that's normal. Even though, of course, any non literate creature wouldn't understand why we're staring at cardboard to order food.

So, for example, we learn that children up to the age of seven invent language ,languages evolved by children. And when you think about this, it makes sense because if anything, that's not learnable by children, up to seven cannot be passed on, so children actually evolved language, not grown ups. <br>	And then I learned about things like Nicaraguan sign language studied by (??) Cengiz and others, where you see a generation of children, deaf children evolve grammar before everyone's eyes, learning how to create more interesting visual constructs to create more and more complex re-combinatorial syntax, which is only found in natural nature and natural languages and DNA, as one of the earlier speakers pointed out. I started playing around with these ideas. What would a future visual language look like? <br><br>And this is this thing called <b>ChalkTalk</b>, where I basically say, okay, so you have this idea of nouns, and because the nouns have a certain quality, they move. But, but maybe the way you draw this thing, so I'm drawing this live now changes the way it moves and. You can tie things together and ask questions. I use it to teach science and computer graphics. So, for example, here, this is a pendulum. And I can also find out like, Oh, what is it about this pendulum that is interesting? And it's that it has actually a sort of decayed sine function. <br><br><center><img id="E23D4082-6963-4B33-AF9E-27935960AFFC" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/71675BAE-519D-46FE-8CB1-2DD64875E04A.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br>But notice that again, in terms of adjectives, if our adverbs, if I draw this thing differently, it's the same object, but it now has different physics and I can tell entire stories with this. So, for example, let's say I wanted to talk about energy conservation, so we have an idea of light. We have an idea of of a motion sensor, and I can tie the motion sensor to the light. And this is the part of the talk where I do a little bit of hand-waving so I can have a hand. And if the hand moves in front of this and all that's going on here is code that anybody can edit. And as you edit this code, different things happen and you can create different sorts of objects. <br>	And just <b>to sort of sum up, </b>by the way, one nice thing is that computers are now millions of times faster than when I first developed procedural textures. So now these procedural textures can happen in real time. This is the same sort of texture I made to make that marble vase, but now it's running many, many times a second and people can do real time design with this. <br><br><center><img id="CDB7C225-265E-44D5-AF87-9955C852D2EC" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/B8C1FB7F-99A7-428C-9D54-CB55611CF09E.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br><b>The software hasn't changed. It's just that the computers have gotten faster and faster and faster.</b> So to sum up, I feel as though language is going to evolve. And I think about little six year old me. And in the future, when kids are able to create and evolve language using a visual component, what's going to be normal, everyday reality is going to basically be like what we today might think of as Harry Potter meets Harold and the Purple Crayon. And I'm hoping that we can all help to make that future of text happen. <br><br><h3 id="D243E148-E106-406C-BC48-2AF665826C7D">Q&amp;A</h3><br><br><b>Alan Laidlaw: </b>I've seen you demo ChalkTalk Ken, many years ago and I love it. And it's been a probably a cornerstone of what I try to build towards and think about. It's interesting in the context of GPT three, seeing the demo again and realizing, Oh, this is like prompt engineering before prompt engineering, which kind of got me thinking around. The.<b> Do you imagine a version of to a general audience of drawing with Chalk Talk?</b> But the response, the translation is wrong. You know, the ball, the pendulum is not what you had in mind, right? Would would the. Would there be a way to I guess in the daily world, you could say like regenerate the image, try again. What are the other possible near matches?<br><b>Ken Perlin: </b>Well, I think language is a funny thing because and this is hard for me to wrap my head around as I started thinking about it. We are all experts. Children are learning machines that are specifically good at learning natural language like language. Natural language is by definition, the thing that children learn really well. You try to teach kids Esperanto and they will spontaneously fix it because it's not a natural language. It doesn't match the way their brains want to learn. And so what Chalk Talk is trying to do in a way, is suggest when you have whatever is the future language, that there then what will be the feeling of that kind of conversation? So clearly, I'm I'm an expert at this. You know, I know what the vocabulary is, but I'm trying to imagine a world where everybody is in on the conversation, which is astonishing, is that every single person on this conversation can spontaneously, with no cognitive load, put together a grammatically correct sentence that's never been uttered before. And we just take that as the the base of human experience. So I'm not too worried about people making mistakes and having errors because that's part of how people talk. You know, somebody said somebody forms a sentence and creates an accidental one. That's just part of the common.<br><b>Alan Laidlaw: </b>So just a quick follow on on that then, because that's interesting that using the metaphor of speaking and creating a language and language evolving 100% on board with. When it comes to drawing the language, writing it out, the just, I guess how much is a. <b>How much there is our hand, a kind of intonation versus a kind of language?</b> Like when we sketch something, we we all sort of sketch arrows differently, right? Is that like a figure of a way of speaking that differentiates us? Is it kind of like a voice, or do you see that the hand being an essential part of. This new evolved language. Does that make sense?<br><b>Ken Perlin: </b>One of the things that I do know a number of people have studied this is that the centers of our brain that control hand manipulation are very strongly tied to the parts of our brain where we use the word articulation for both verbal language and our hands. And in fact, there are some there are theories that the parts that are the language parts evolved out of the parts that are used for prehensile manipulation. So and in fact, everybody that you watch that speaks, they just automatically start moving their hands. So there already is a very strong connection. And I think if you look at the the beauty of what's been created and not here in communities with sign languages, which are incredible, I mean, they're just there's this there's this wonderful power of simultaneity that we don't have as serial speakers that I think we can all move toward that.<br><br><b>Fabien Benetou: </b>I remember I tried ChalkTalk , I think, in 2019 when you presented it at NYU and released it on GitHub. And <b>I remember cardboard mode, but I don't remember trying it in VR</b>. Namely that you would, let's say, pinch in the air to start to do the same shapes and then be in immersive mode, even though it is web based. I'm wondering, has it have you tried that before? If not, it not. Wasn't it interesting? And if you haven't tried it, why not?<br><b>Ken Perlin: </b>Well, we've ported in our lab at NYU. We've ported chalk talk to shared socially shared VR, and we just look at it as one of the aspects of the many, many research questions about sharing virtual and extended worlds together. We don't focus entirely on the language question, but it is one of the things that we look at. So it's in there, but we also look at, for example, asymmetries and scale. How do you how do you use virtual characters as agents? And they're just lots and lots and lots of the relationship between tangible objects and their virtual proxies. But one of the things we do look at is gestures as semantic creation.<br><br><b>Brandel Zachernuk: </b>Thank you for the talk and for the presentation on ChalkTalk. I'm curious as to the sort of the extent of the utility that you found in real experiments with Chopped talk. I recall Ivan Sutherland talking in the nineties about sketchpad in the in the sixties, saying that ultimately it only really had two uses. One was to present the graphics for his thesis and the other was to draw some hexagons for his mother. And he never asked why she wanted them and the limitations being that a lot of things need representations or metal representations that that he wasn't able to come up with a graceful representation for. How do you find how have you tried and how do you find scaling chalk talk and what ends up being representational and where it ends up software?<br><b>Ken Perlin: </b>Well, the big secret to  ChalkTalk is that and this I got this insight from from I got to meet my my one and only hero who just like Ozma which is Randall Munroe who does xkcd and he I asked him what he thought about and he suggested a chalk talk and he said, draw the simplest possible thing. So what I found was the big insight was I go up to I want to say, Oh, I want to draw a planet or I draw an A person or I want to draw a duck. I go up to a whiteboard and make the simplest possible drawing, and I find that that's the right visual representation to start. And behind that I can put whatever code I want. I mean, I believe sketchpad was very pure. It was doing everything. I mean, I've been doing everything through this very pure system of constraints, and Chalk Talk is really a hodgepodge of techniques. It's really a way of, of, of sort of having an interface without apps so that instead of here's an app and here's an app, everything can talk to everything else. So I would I'd say I'm not running into the same limitations he was running into because I'm not trying to make something pure. I'm just basically trying to make something to present ideas for people. And if I have a new idea, I program it. I come up with some simple representation. I have ways of morphing things, and I think he was going for something much more idealistic in 1968 than what I'm going for. So it may be a little apples and oranges.<br><br><b>Andreea Ion Cojocaru: </b>Hi. Thank you so much for this. This is wonderful. Are you thinking of this tool more in the sense of a cognitive tool or a communication tool? And I'll try to qualify that. I've been reading a bunch of Barbara Tversky studies and two of them come to mind that might be relevant in this context. One, she, she, she, she found out that when people are presented with a process or a mechanism that they need to understand, when she asked them to use gestures to mimic the movements of the process of the mechanism, they learn better. And also, when she asked them to sketch out the steps involved, they also learn better. But she also has a study on animations, and she actually found that where people were shown an animation when all the parts are moving, they it ended up not helping as much as they thought they would. So there seems to be something about either the internal movement of the mind trying to understand or a movement of the body trying to help the mind move and understand versus the low hanging fruit of just being given the movement that seem to be quite advantageous in terms of a cognitive approach, a cognitive perspective. And I believe Barbara is in the audience. So I this is more also a prompt for her to to step forward and correct my interpretation of her work. Thank you.<br><b>Ken Perlin: </b>Yeah, I'm a big fan, of course, of Barbara Tversky's work, and I've learned a lot from reading her papers and having conversations with her. And I think it strongly informs what we do. As I mentioned to the previous answer, Chalk Talk is one of the early artists. Chalk Talk is just a component of the kinds of questions we like to ask in our lab and the question of embodiment and in fact, shared embodiment between multiple people is really important. And all of her work, not just on that you cited, but also the use of dictates. Like when I'm in the same room with somebody as she and her students showed, you can say this or that or then or refer to things implicitly. And because things are embodied and you have gesture and eye gaze, etc., you're able to use language in this more implicit way, which is very, very powerful. So we're hoping that everything that we do will lead to a trajectory where people are in their bodies and using the full power of language which is meant to be used together with evolved to be used together with the physical embodied human in the same room. And I. Temporarily being stuck on Zoom is doing a terrible disservice to our power as humans, because who am I looking at right now? We are really, really good at integrating language with attention, direction, and I think once the technology catches up to the studies that she's doing, we're going to get a lot more out of these communicative technologies.<br><hr style="width:10%;"> <br><br><h1 id="881AA1D9-7BB3-42F8-A867-B750BF476228">Livia Polanyi</h1><br><br><center><h2 id="1E58EA9E-680E-4386-9DDA-66C90CD26FCC">Virtual Vision</h2><br></center><br>I have bad eyes. They don't focus together and reading is difficult. I read almost exclusively on my tablet now which limits my choice of material largely to e- books. Very few scholarly or academic books are available for the screen and they are expensive especially for people without access to a university library system. <br>	At the moment, propelled by a nagging curiosity to read about the work of the psychoanalyst, D. W. Winnicott, I have broken out of my digital prison and am currently deeply immersed in the messy theoretical and personal wars that roiled British psychoanalysis for the first half of the last century. Currently, I have ordered a “marks of paper” volume about the life and work of Melanie Klein, a formidable force who led one of the main combatant forces in the conflict to increase my understanding of what went on and, while am awaiting delivery on that book, I am breaking up my reading about Winnicott with quick dives into a volume of short biographies of Freud's patients Ì¶ whom he seemed to have been of no use to Ì¶and a hard cover dealing with obsessives who collect 78 rpm records. <br>So here I sit, in my oversized comfy brown leather chair, with a small pile of books that is about to grow larger strewn about within reach of my arms. One volume on my lap, perhaps, another on a table to my left, the third wedged in between me and the side of the chair. Finding where I broke off reading one when switching to another is always a bit of a hassle and locating a delicious quote to share with someone else requires fumbling around and frequent giving up before I locate the titbit. Of course, my tablet and phone are close at hand, too, since I need to chase down references, read up on articles I can get access to in the web, consider buying another book, get lost in some side path triggered by something or other and, of course, capture images of particularly interesting, enraging or downright silly passages I come across in my sedentary voyages across various landscapes. <br>	So, what does this all have to do with text, knowledge, XR? Well, quite a lot actually. Allow me for a moment to propel myself into an XR future scenario. I am once more at work pursuing knowledge, the books I am reading strewn about my digital chair. I move from one to the other and from the books to other digital resources effortlessly, simply asking for which one I need now or maybe merely searching out the volume I want with my eyes. Following up on a reference, a question, an intuition is a snap Ì¶ I merely request more information and it appears Ì¶ similarly notes to myself I might want to make or messages I might want to send to others can be composed merely by asking they be created. Those memoranda can easily include all the information I or my correspondent might need to access the sources mentioned. Capturing texts and creating linked files or other representation of exact quotations, relevant images, sources consulted or to be consulted and even snarky comments appear almost with the speed of thought. Editing, changing, deleting Ì¶ are effortless. Physically still seated in my comfy leather chair with a cup of non-digital tea nearby, my mind roams freely through an imaginary library, filled with digital tools and resources, trusted amanuenses and tireless creators of indices and notations that allow me to wander through the fields of knowledge whether from psychoanalysis to vintage recording collection or from any topic to any other topic where my mind and poor sight want to go. <br>	While physical books are comforting “transitional objects”, I look forward to roaming around a virtual library, my personal reality augmented by emerging technologies. While seated in my chair, drinking my entirely real world cup of tea. Unlike Captain Picard, however, I will prepare my tea in a real kitchen. It will not be Earl Grey. <br><br><center><img id="630F4D38-467D-42F5-81DA-87060027F798" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/E5156866-3DDB-45E5-B580-93749C27A6AB.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br><h1 id="666209D4-C66D-484D-9711-17FDB54C5D26">Lorenzo Bernaschina</h1><br><br><center><h2 id="581734CF-FD83-49EE-82F0-5BCA648FF886">Gems</h2><br></center><br>Gems&nbsp;is a personal knowledge management tool to explore and connect ideas visually with the help of AI<br><br>The total amount of information in the world is growing exponentially. Information overload is everywhere: on media, in companies, at school, on both our physical desks and digital desktops. There is a hyper-production of content and many contradictory sources available. Finding signals in the noise is becoming increasingly challenging and expensive. In 1982, Richard Buckminster Fuller estimated the knowledge production rate of humankind. In his book "Critical Path" he described the "knowledge doubling curve" by explaining that the rate at which information doubled was getting faster and faster.<br>	Today knowledge workers are drowning in information they don’t have time to process. We save interesting web articles and social posts we rarely revisit. We have messy desktops and folders. We have many books we barely have time to read, let alone interpret and digest. Same for newsletters, videos, podcasts, PDFs etc.<br>	To&nbsp;make sense of this flood of information and make use of it,&nbsp;we have note-taking tools&nbsp;and&nbsp;cloud storage services that share a common design pattern:<br><br><li>They are built around hierarchical file directories (folders) which are the digital equivalent of the filing cabinets or shelves we had before the existence of computers and software. Back in the early days of personal computers and&nbsp;GUIs, designers needed to make them as familiar as possible to users. So they made&nbsp;skeuomorphic&nbsp;adaptations of the Desktop, the Trash, etc. Similarly, it felt natural to keep digital information organized as the physical one. It was easier to be adopted by users but the drawback was it didn’t leverage the full potential of the new tool. It’s hard to keep information updated, create cross-references, find patterns, surface ideas, or even just find something in filing cabinets and shelves (the&nbsp;Zettelkasten of Niklas Luhmann&nbsp;is probably the most audacious endeavor in this regard). These limits are reflected in file directories.</li><br><li>To overcome them, they introduced tags and metadata, so we can attach semantic meaning to each note or file. However, it is manual work that requires a lot of cognitive effort. It’s time-consuming and the larger the knowledge base, the harder it is to keep it consistent over time. We have to set conventions that are difficult to follow because sometimes we forget to add a label, sometimes we say “I’ll do it later” (which is never), sometimes we use synonyms or slightly different spelling, etc. </li><br><li>For many of them, the primary interface is a text editor. This forces us to think linearly within the boundaries of the page. It’s hard to see how the moving parts of a learning topic or project come together from there. </li><br><br>Because of these design choices, existing note-taking tools&nbsp;and&nbsp;cloud storage services act as passive storage containers. We create a note or save a file, add some tags, and leave them in a folder that we rarely revisit. We have to remember what kind of information we saved in the first place. We have to know what keywords or search methods will allow us to find it again. We have to develop ways to integrate old ideas with new ones. We have to prompt ourselves to expand on our notes, combine them, synthesise them into new realisations, and critique our own conclusions. <b>None of these tools is designed to help us draw associations between concepts, which is how we really make sense of the world and generate new ideas.<br></b><br>Gems is designed to encourage associative and non-linear thinking through a combination of graph visualization and artificial intelligence:<br><br><li>The main interface is an infinite whiteboard. You can import, create and visually arrange notes on it. You can group notes into nested layers as in folders, but keep visual references between them with connections. So you have a flexible structure that matches your non-linear way of thinking, to build networks of thoughts instead of siloed containers that don’t talk to each other.</li><br><li>On top of it,&nbsp;AI constantly indexes your knowledge base. If you need to observe notes from non-trivial angles, such as semantic similarity, you can ask the AI to do it for you. You can make sense of retrieved results in dedicated views and make updates from there (e.g. connecting two similar notes) which will automatically reflect in the knowledge base. Once you return to the main whiteboard, you will see how the updates fit into the rest of your knowledge structure and you can rearrange some of it accordingly. This helps you review your overall understanding of a topic in light of the new insights suggested by the AI.</li><br><br>If you are a lifelong learner, for example, you can visually build a map of concepts from your readings and ask the AI to suggest connections between them. If you are a non-fiction writer, you can keep track of all the sources and use AI to get a list of the most relevant to write an outline in a fraction of the time. If you are a fiction writer, the whiteboard helps you build the narrative world of your story visually, define characters, places, events, and see how they come together in your plot. <br>	Artificial intelligence and human intelligence ultimately solve very different classes of problems. Machines are very good at processing a huge amount of information fast. We are very good at finding meanings, generating new original ideas and making connections between them. The magic happens when we combine the two. Gems captures the semantics of both your brain and AI, the former through the digital whiteboard, the latter through sophisticated&nbsp;large language models, and makes them communicate together harmoniously.<br>	Computer science was born with the promise of&nbsp;extending the human mind with technology. Personal computers have kept the promise and now the technology is ready to take that bold vision forward with AI. That’s why I focused my studies on it after graduating in software engineering.

Here, a few of the unexpected issues are explored with implications both for human users and the tools they employ in this context. The user’s methods and their tools both need some improvements to make the most of these new opportunities. Bolded text indicates sections of note for the skim-reader. Re-using infographics in VR need more effort than merely adding a simple image map.<br><br><h3 id="7B0F9470-B599-417E-BD94-EE0C11800D7B">Background</h3><br><br>The Future of Text (FoT) weekly discussions have included exploration of interacting with infographics in VR, using Bob Horn’s various murals† as the initial subject matter. Doing so, it became clear that a number of issues associated with that process are not well integrated, tool support is poor and that more explanatory documentation would be helpful.<br><br><h3 id="20B8C9A3-737B-4ED8-86FF-3FBD83E931CB">The Problem Space</h3><br><br>Whilst this exploration started with the above murals, the process is actually generic to moving any infographic from 2D to VR/AR use. Within that, there are two types of presentation to consider: bitmap/raster vs. vector graphics. Not considered here is the further complication of static displays based on dynamic data (static render of a dynamic source). A further issue is a degree of mismatch of the 2D pixel concept and 3D modelling methods.<br>	It is reasonable for the casual reader to not care, personally, about the differences of the 2D vs. 3D/VR medium. But for those intending to move artefacts from one to the other—or create artefacts for such re-mediation, the differences of the two media’s design methods and formats do affect re-mediation in VR.<br><br><h3 id="232BC611-B5EB-4AF0-984B-695DBAD9DEFB">Display in 2D and bitmap (raster) vs. vector formats</h3><br><br>On a 2D screen a pixel originally described the smallest discretely addressable part of the screen, an area that can hold a discrete colour value or pixel (explained†). In a bitmap† image each the image grid maps 1-to-1 with a pixel. In reality, it is far more complex than the simple physical grid we imagine partly due to constant improvements in displays, leading to notions like the ‘CSS pixel’.<br>	Vector artwork defines an image in terms of a series shapes that can have strokes (borders) and/or fills. The vector approach makes the image independent of any particular resolutions (i.e. pixel size). However, such artwork is almost always rasterised on-the-fly to display it on a normal 2D display, though it allows scaling without loss of clarity <i>(if</i> scaling is applied before the image is rasterised).<br><br><h3 id="D93F159E-9BF7-4DDC-9667-ACD2D88CCB6D">The (HTML) Image Map</h3><br><br>It is useful to describe the image map in the context of the Web for two reasons. Firstly it is the context in which the reader is most likely to have met the concept. Secondly, discussions in the <i>FoT</i> group have suggested that Web, or Web-compatible, standards will be important in how our work may move to/from the VR environment.<br>	An image map defines (non-overlapping) shapes <i>within</i> the area of a webpage apportioned for a given image. The aim is interactivity: clicking on map area A opens link X, whilst clicking on area B opens link Y, etc. Thus one map may contain links to many different resources.<br>	Image maps have been with us since the very early days of the Web. Insertion of images in web pages were first proposed† by Marc Andreessen in early 1993† and shortly after Mosaic added an ‘&lt;ismap&gt;’ element† which was essentially the first image map, implemented server-side. <b>Even then, Tim Berners-Lee had noted that whilst fine for bitmaps, this mapping method was less useful for vector artwork</b>†—though the latter was not used natively in Web pages  at the time. Though current web browsers can now support the vector SVG format, crucially, the image map areas (shapes) are defined in pixels as offsets within the host images declared display size.<br>	In 1997, the server-side ‘ISMAP’ concept was adopted as the W3C HTML v3.2’s client-side ‘map’ element† and it lives on into the current W3C HTML5 specification†. Initially popular, especially for page navigation sections, push-back against use of text embedded in images saw interest move on. As a result image maps, implemented in HTML, are encountered far less often.<br>	Pertinent too, is the fact that software tools had to adapt fast to add features to make map mark-up easy; Adobe had to quickly develop a whole new tool ImageReady† (later subsumed into Photoshop) and similar happened for other vendors. This problem of<b> a lag of affordances for new uses in our creative tools continues, as elaborated below.<br></b><br><h3 id="43805C3A-2617-4602-BEFA-787CFF6BBBFC">Raster vs. Vector Data</h3><br><br>In the early Web images were all raster graphics†, those using the 2D ‘pixel’ grid, were the only graphics supported. This is the type of data for which the above image map was envisaged.<br>Much more recently vector graphics† arrived in the form of SVG†. Another visualisation form is the HTML &lt;canvas&gt; element† that uses JavaScript to draw shapes, in a vector-like manner but essentially results in a rasterised display. Most recently we have the likes of WebGL that can draw shapes in 2D or 3D†. Whilst these methods support embedded interactions there appears to be no consistent notion of an image map. <b>Unsurprisingly this means that relevant image creation tools lack affordances for making ‘image’ maps.<br></b>	Whilst static infographics (i.e. with no dynamic elements†, like the murals above) can be brought into a VR space and displayed, they offer little further affordance unless within the context of a web browser object. There is no simple and consistent way to interact with the data (of which more below). These ‘dumb’ documents were designed to be displayed and read but not for digital interaction, especially in a VR environment; this poses a challenge for digital enrichment and re-mediation. <b>Static images/charts have limitations for easy VR enrichment &amp; remediation.<br></b>	Simply displaying the graphic in VR, as if a painting on a wall, is comparatively simple. The harder part is being able to interact with a particular element—or a set of elements—within the image. This might be to explore the sources of an annotation or the issue it addresses. Or, it might be to re-present content in a different type of view, such as in a timeline. Consider too, tha<b>t the source image—or its VR frame—will potentially be folded, zoomed or skewed in a manner that displays the graphic differently from its normal 2D display;</b> this may occur either to display it on the surface of a 3D object or to re-mediate the content into other visualisations.<br><br><h3 id="76B81EF2-E8F3-4E9B-AA1A-9FB9201232C1">Issues for Presentation of Infographics in VR</h3><br><br>Given the newness of VR, unsurprisingly <b>the larger amount of infographics we might wish to bring into VR today predate notions of such use, </b>so it is useful to consider legacy files from those we may create today or in the future.<br><b><br></b><h3 id="F6662679-1E19-4DB9-8DF5-5814DF60B73A">Displaying image data in VR</h3><br><br>Here, methods are less well defined than for 2D, reflecting the newness of the medium. An important point is to understand that <b>3D/VR is not created using cubic pixels,</b> i.e. a direct extension of the 2D pixel. Image data, such as infographics, will normally end up as a<b> rasterised fill laid onto the surface of a 3D object; </b>this potentially removes some existing advantages of vector formats (in 2D). <br>	Even if displayed in VR like a picture hung on a wall, the ‘picture’ is still part of a 3D object—albeit of tiny depth—so skeuomorphic 2D descriptions can be unintentionally unhelpful: <b>skeuomorphic descriptions help describe the visual experience but can obfuscate how it is constructed.</b><br><br><h3 id="75D3E17B-A0E7-48EA-BE5C-1F37BC93E180">All surfaces are not web displays</h3><br><br>One way to display existing images is in an object that holds a web browser object, but that then interposes another whole layer of structure (the web browser) to ‘just’ display a picture. If the display has a dynamic element it may be useful—indeed necessary—in the short term to use an embedded browser object. Yet, if we wish to interact with an infographic, must the targets of the interactions be an endless growing collection of browser objects? If so, we should give attention to lighter ‘weight’ web objects so multiple use doesn’t generate unseen and unwanted overhead. <b>Do we always need a ‘full’ browser object to display a usable HTML image map?</b><br><br><h3 id="2C1805CD-DCD6-4A0F-BA89-8BB7E8AFE86F">What is to be linked and where will the linked resource be found?</h3><br><br>The HTML image map assumes a (click) interaction loads a URL. Originally, those URLs would have been web pages but now might be any valid resource such as a query-driven dataset relating to the clicked source. A question to ask, given the FoT group’s focus on Visual-Meta and local resolution, is that—for new documents—what of the linked data travels in(side) the mapped artwork, or as a local but discrete (‘sidecar’) resource, or simply uses a URL and trusts to the current environment to de-reference it? <b>How much re-mediating data should travel in/with the main image?<br></b>	Considering this has implications for how data (transfer) format should evolve to support movement into and out of VR, as for a while work will likely involved mixed environment use or AR. Additionally, the type and range of environments my vary by participant in a shared workspace, so a ‘one size fits all’ is over-optimistic.<br>	Hitherto stable text formats like RTF† (or text+image RTFD†) served the paper age well but their utility is lessened when re-mediation benefits from access to the document structure and style information is stored separately from the text, making it easier for different media to style optimally for that medium whilst reflecting the spirit of the author’s intent. RTF hides that relationship. Although RTFD stores image data outside the RTF stream, the intermixing of style and content in the text still remains..<br>	Whether data always need be strictly Web-compatible is not yet clear. <b>But the Web’s notion of a ‘DOM’ (Document Object Model†) is useful—the exposure of a text’s </b><b><i>semantic structure.</i></b><i> </i>Whether only for anchoring visual styling or for allowing more complex interactions, a DOM—or similar structural description—clearly offers more in the VR environment than in 2D. <b>In 3D, we are less strongly bound to manifesting essentially Print-era presentation </b>and may more readily move to more complex interactions and reconstructions.<br><br><h3 id="254C64D5-57B6-42DA-ADFC-83F7E6A0F3BC">Legacy Files—re-mediating pre-existing resources</h3><br><br>For raster images, using a Web (HTML) ‘frame’ to hold an infographic image is a tractable approach for creating discrete interactions but the frame object requirement may limit the ability to do much more than display/scale the image. Plus there are the scale issues of using multiple such object, as already discussed. Unless the source is high resolution, a paucity of pixels may also limit effective transformations in VR.<br>	For vector files the image will, at present, likely be <i>rendered</i> in raster form even if from a vector source. So the click event anchors directly to the HTML defined area. Less clear is whether direct interaction with SVG embedded in a web object offers an advantage. For instance, it is also unclear how the SVG click event responds if part of the parent image is folded (i.e. hidden). Most likely, in a web frame context, this will be down to the browser object rather than the VR object on which it is displayed. Thus for some transforms and extra level of complexity is added: to transform the 3D object, the limitations of the embedded browser must be acknowledged.<br><br><h3 id="F05A21F6-1C71-4207-B91C-BDFBC66C9FE4">Current files—content designed for combined 2D/3D use</h3><br><br>For pre-existing images little changes for raster files as the HTML image map remains in the HTML specification. By comparison, vector artwork mapping could improve considerably if creative tools were to add clearer tools for marking/mapping images and making it easy to connect the right data but that may be over-optimistic.<br>	As vector artwork offers greater scope for transformation, also open is the nature of the the likes of the SVG click event (as discrete from an HTML image map click).  <b>Rather than simply point to a URL as in the past, the event might actually trigger a visual transformation, reveal extra information, etc.</b><br>	Indeed, being able to ‘paint’ the SVG data more directly onto a VR object without a ‘browser’ layer would offer a less complex interaction moving in and out of VR, even if only in the volume of cross-environment traffic.<br><br><h3 id="2A229CE9-84C9-4972-A55C-462775F5455A">The nature of VR interaction</h3><br><br>Even having imported an infographic into VR, drawn it onto a suitable object, we now need to consider interaction. Due to the way an infographic may be rendered onto a VR object, we may know what we wish to ‘click’, but doing so may not be so easy. A busy graphic may require fine-grained interaction to reach a specific point of interest but that must nonetheless match the fine-positioning ability of the interacting agent (human or otherwise), or else the degree of interaction is impoverished.<br>	A useful affordance of VR is to give a limitless screen allowing for large changes of scale. Therefore, if interactive elements are tightly positioned within a 2D design, there needs to be some sort of metadata to signal the creator’s intent as to what—if anything—becomes an interaction target when the granularity of discrete targets is finer than that of the interacting agent. To do this requires a means to the creator of the infographic to define and store that information; such features do not yet existing meaningfully in mainstream creative tools.<br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><h3 id="0D870C2A-0922-4036-92A3-1D01AF2DA76F">Tool support for linking and re-mediation</h3><br><br>Creative tools do seem to be a current constraining factor. These are not the tools used by the prototypers at the leading edge, where the tools themselves are evolving. Rather, the tools for the ordinary creators who represent the larger volume of such creative work. For instance, when a new infographic is planned and which will have a lot of mapped (linked) resources, it would be useful to be able add a pre-structured grid of links or per-VR-addressable-item layers. In parallel, it may help to have methods where more complex data is simply bound via a GUID, and the GUIDS mapped with to either a grid- or layer-based document structure. <b>Such VR-mapping-inclusive thinking does not yet seem present in the design of large scale creative tools. <br></b>	However, the example of early Web graphics offer a clear example of how change is problematic for established genres of creative tools. New features can be added but this is not necessarily optimal for the user. <b>When adapting for new methods it is not always optimal to simply try to force new methods into old processes. </b>This is a challenge, because for new environments like VR, the necessary feature set for tools is not yet defined. The experimental nature of prototyping means that it may only hint at such features—unless the prototyping is intended to codify new processes and the tools/features to service it.<br>	Lest some of these new tasks seem trivial, take as an example Bob Horn’ s mural† on the UK’s nuclear waste program. Whether in vector or raster form, the discrete textual elements alone number over 450 (i.e possible discrete click targets), without even addressing some of the purely pictorial with which the VR user might wish to interact. Consider the task, today, of defining each target, manually, and its associated target data. This shows we need tools to allow intake, into an otherwise purely creative space, of structured data that can ether be used to scaffold the infographic creation (i.e. one object per layer).  Alternatively, we need a means to rapidly attach data to each large numbers of objects in the source file.<br>	Even with such new tools, <b>user education matters—we can’t just assume everything is intuitive or made usable by ‘someone else’.</b> The gap between imagined exploratory re-use of existing infographic data and what any but the expert may achieve remains large. For the person trying to use such material in VR, there is a human issue of education: both understanding the implications of thinking beyond legacy static publishing notions and an interest in and learning of the tools that can deliver a richer VR experience.<br><br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><h3 id="A0AFB98F-EFF6-48B8-BBF9-881C555DE906">Conclusion</h3><br><br>If our temptation is to think “we will just use an image map” as the process for infographic display in VR, it suggests that in our rush to imagine VR working we aren’t also taking time to consider the emerging process to render our imaginings. It may be the case that image maps are a part of the solution but aren’t the complete answer. Why so? <b>An image map with appropriate data, is only a help if the rendering tool can understand it, whilst even appropriate data is insufficient if the human user doesn’t fully understand creation of that data or know which tools if any they can use to make or manipulate the data.</b><br>	Even if all or most VR objects are essentially browser-type displays, an image map with appropriate enrichment data is only a help if the VR environment can render it, whilst retaining the ability for appropriate interaction. Alongside this metadata is insufficient if the human user doesn’t fully understand the how to structure the data for interaction nor has the tools at their disposal to do this other than manually.<br>	Thus it is that (re-)using infographics in VR go beyond the current notion of the thing we call an image map.<br><br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><h3 id="084913C4-26D6-4326-BEBF-D63280826B1F">Reflections on working in VR so far</h3><br><br>I come to VR from the perspective of how and why things are constructed, i.e. how the environment and affordances we may make know what they are and what may be done with them. This is perhaps a divergent view to much exploration that works back from the desired/imagined output. Separately, I’m looking for exploration spaces for deconstruction. Simulacra of the real world are fine for other forms of work but for exploratory/analytical work such objects merely add visual noise to the task at hand. But, other work needs different environments; there is no one-size-fits-all.<br>	VR Reflections (using: Oculus Quest 2). New to VR in general, the most arresting thing on first use was the verisimilitude of ‘passthrough’. Even when only in grey scale the detail was impressive and gave more sense to how useful AR may be for some work scenarios. Interesting too was the notion of a work/play space ‘boundary’ and the ability to use passthrough outside the boundary. Reading was a poorer experience than I’d imagined, but for understandable technical limitations of current equipment.<br>	Otherwise, despite the impressive demos and presentations seen, it strikes me that the exploratory work I tend to do is some way off in VR. This is not a limitation of the medium but simply reflects the immaturity of the available tools. We are not far beyond where it is necessary to build the tools before we can make anything in VR, and practically this severely limits the number of those who can ‘just’ do something useful in VR. But the technology and the tools will evolve so I read current limitations in that context.<br>	It is clear that an understanding of hypertext (as a superset of the ‘Web’) has much to offer regarding work and use of text in VR. Linkage, addressability and separation of content from style are key issues as text shuttles between actual reality and VR—and help non-human agents ‘read’ text without the pollution of style (for human consumption) which they cannot understand. Visual-Meta, as a concept rather than a specific format, should also prove useful as more information needs to travel between the literal and the VR environment.<br><hr style="width:10%;"><br><br><h1 id="33CD95BD-BBB4-48E2-8AEB-D165500674D9">Matthias Müller-Prove</h1><br><br><center><h2 id="5C316886-378E-4BDC-B512-D6B5E18C3EFE">On Real and Virtual Text</h2><br><br></center>Naomi silently moves her tongue with out opening her mouth.

Spoken language is linear. Spoken language can be turned into text by writing it down. Text is linear to the extent that it consists of rows of words, separated by automatic line feeds at the margin, or by hard <i>carriage return</i> control characters to give way to a new thought in the following paragraph. Once a sheet of paper is filled up, the words continue their journey on the next page… until this is full… and so on… The sheets of paper pile up to form a book. A book is a physical object in real life.<br>	Books are a natural habitat for text – same as magazines, newspapers, reports, hand-written letters… basically all paper-based media. Before capturing the messages on paper or papyrus our ancestors used to impress clay or carve in stone. A few thousand years later we use invisible magnetic or electronic charges as computer storage and memory. Each charged physical spot represents a bit, a binary digit 1 or 0. Eight bits to the byte and a decoding convention like ASCII or Unicode – these are the basic principles to interpret the bits as characters and to display them with glowing pixels on screen. All three modalities of text – pre-paper, paper, digital – are still in use today; for instance (i) on gravestones, (ii) for the classical publishing industry, and (iii) for all kinds of computer media from personal word processing to social media.<br>	Text is linear – thinking is not. Language has the expressive power to put complex ideas into words by utilising its meta-referential properties. This enables an author to directly approach a reader and point to certain sections of the text. Complex causalities or abstract ideas can be described and discussed with words. New concepts or things can be handled by assigning new names, and by putting them in context with familiar terms. In fact it is quite difficult to find words that are not metaphorically derived from prior words. Quotes are often used to indicate that a word is not meant as such but shall be understood in a metaphorical sense. ‘Virtual’ is another attribute to inform readers that the following word should not be taken literally. We will discuss “virtual reality” further below.<br>	A discussion among several people can be captured with linear text – as long as they do not speak at the same time. If they do anyway, we would either need a multi-track score like music notation for the instruments of an orchestra, or the text itself explains that the following sentences are meant to be spoken simultaneously. That would be an example of written language’s meta-referentiality. Footnotes are like a second track as well. They are anchored to the main body, i.e. a little spatial hint which indicates when reading the side track might be intended and appropriate.<br><br><h3 id="EA175D2A-F3C5-4E5D-AF0B-6A2F49ECCAC9">From Text to Online</h3><br><br><i>Hypertext</i> – a term coined by Ted Nelson in the early 1960s – is non-sequential writing. Text passages are individual units. They can be connected by hyperlinks to provide related content to each other. Each link bears the invitation to follow a different, but somehow connected thought though a rabbit hole. {Naomi smiles.} Quotes and references are a primary citizen in hypertext because the origin can alway be accessed in its original context. Link and reference structures are visible on screen, e.g. as lines or coloured shapes between related text sections. [Ted Nelson, 1972: Parallel Textface™ in Xanadou™ in Matthias Müller-Prove, 2002: Vision and Reality of Hypertext and Graphical User Interfaces, section 2.1.2†] 60 years after the idea of hypertext, the online environment is not a dream come true. <br>	On the pro side, the Internet is a common communications infrastructure connecting all continents. It delivers all kinds of data and services to each point on the planet. A tremendous success and innovation which shall be used in a beneficial way for all of us. However…â€¨	The Web as we know it today has almost nothing to do with the original vision of an interconnected dynamic global library. The only link between hypertext of the 1960s and the Web of the 1990s are hyperlinks between Web pages. Even Web 2.0 is history already. <i>Web 2.0</i> was a term made popular by O’Reilly’s Web 2.0 conference series in the 2000s. It is the shift from tech-savvy or professional website creators to average people who want to upload “user generated content” and edit their personal pages. Web 2.0 is the beginning of a democratic medium where everybody can participate and easily edit wikis and write blog articles for the interconnected blogosphere. Since the 2010s big tech and media corporations rule the market, for instance Meta (facebook, instagram, WhatsApp, Meta Quest 2 and presumably the Metaverse), Amazon (Kindle, Echo, Prime, AWS), Apple (Mac, iPhone, iPads, Watch, podcasting, TV), google (search, YouTube, Android, A.I. research),  Microsoft (LinkedIn, Teams, Skype, Flight Simulator), Zoom, Twitter (a global micro-blogging platform until its acquisition in October 2022). Tencent (Qzone, WeChat) and Sina (Weibo) dominate the market in China while ByteDance’ TikTok is popular around the globe. This list is far from being comprehensive. Games is a huge sector that is also quite relevant for VR because level designers already have the know-how to create engaging 3D worlds.<br>	The most important revenue stream is selling ads. Therefore the social media platforms do massively collect user data to offer micro-targeting services to marketeers. For short: user’s online time and behavioural usage profiles are sold to run targeted commercial and political campaigns.

Back to text.<br><br><h3 id="70F14FB2-5FE2-440E-BFF8-BD5284B34F9F">Cool Reading</h3><br><br>Reading is a linear repetitive activity. It is a fast cascade of focussing the words to harvest their meaning. Not every word is deciphered one by one. Instead the eye jumps 3 to 7 times per line to send sharp signals to the brain. Frequent reading improves the ability to detect certain patterns in the shape of text to obtain the meaning quite efficiently. <br>	Reading a detective story remains linear even in case of cheating: Reading the last pages first is just a different order of reading the one-dimensional text. Scientific papers use footnotes or offer supplemental material in the appendix. Reading is optional; it’s up to the reader to take any way through a text.<br>	Even reading hypertext is a linear activity. At certain points in text-space and personal-time the reader makes a deliberate decision to jump to a next chunk of text. Therefore browsing hypertext remains personally linear. However the reader (or user) might get lost in cyberspace. Then it is a matter of information architecture to provide a useful and usable navigation structure with sufficient hints to guide the reader (or user) along an intended trail.<br>	According to Marshall McLuhan speech is a cold medium: <i>»so little is given and so much has to be filled in by the listener.«</i> [Marshall McLuhan, 1964: Understanding Media, chapter 2]. Even more so when speech is delivered as text. Intonation, mood, and any body language of the speaker or author are missing during a pure reading experience.<br>	Reading is a cool activity – like in cool jazz. The reader has to contribute her own background and fantasy to unfold the whole story. Reading text stimulates the brain to create a mental theatre with the plot and ideas that are encapsulated in black ink on white paper.<br>	A similar phenomenon is called <i>closure</i> [Scott McCloud, 1993: Understanding Comics]<i>.</i> The reader of comic strips has to close the gaps between frames by imagining the missing pictures.

The user experiences a 3D world which is projected into a sphere of pixels and an endless audio track is playing over headphones. Alternatives to head mounted displays should be mentioned as well: For instance the CAVE (Cave Automatic Virtual Environment) is a stereo projection inside a box – large enough for a human to make a few steps. Other systems use large rooms covered with curved OLED displays behind protection glass on the floor. Amusement parks try to attract people with 360 domes – similar to planetarium’s night sky projections. All systems have some advantages and also some drawbacks for certain contexts of use. Technical requirements, affordability, ergonomic form factor of the hardware, availability and compatibility of software, interoperability with other computer platforms, interactivity, the lack of well established VR design patterns and poor usability… just to name a few issues that need to be addressed.<br>	On the other hand there are several features of VR that make the platform desirable and interesting to explore new concepts – not just for gaming. VR offers more degrees of freedom than TV or cinema, i.e. the user can turn the head to look around, change her position by “walking”, and interact with virtual objects by “touching” “buttons” and “pulling” “levers”. Hand tracking and gesture recognition is necessary to interact with virtual objects.<br>	The term <i>immersion</i> is used as a quality measure how convincing the VR experience is, whether the user believes to be “really - there - now”. The sensational impression of presence is supported by high resolution 3D graphics, high refresh rates, and extremely short lag times on turning the head to mitigate motion sickness.<br>	It depend on the implementation effort of the development team whether believable creatures or humanoid characters populate the scenery and whether ambient sound provides subtle cues und realistic flavours during acting inside the VR environment. Good quality in all these aspects is necessary to offer an immersive experience. <br>	VR is a slightly cooler medium than TV because the user can interact with the scenery and change the flow of events. In other words, VR requires physical und mental user participation while a cinema experience can be watched and enjoyed quite motionless from the armchair. But VR is definitely a hot medium compared to text because reading text requires creative imagination to revive the written words. Ready-made VR world just need to be observed.<br>	It always poses problems when cold and hot medium categories compete on the user’s attention. Images draw attention over text. Videos draw attention over text and images. As a young medium, VR requires the most amount of lead time to get started before use. The perceived cost/value relation of reading in VR is just too high at the moment.<br><br><h3 id="C25A879A-C716-4381-B16D-C87795B3409E">Real Text in the Virtual World</h3><br><br>Text is text independent from the medium, whether it be paper or pixels. But since McLuhan’s <i>»The medium is the message«</i> we must consider the channel, the display properties, the interaction design, and the social context.<br>	Text in the post-paper modality is mostly used for news and information or for personal short text forms like e-mail, micro-blogging, public or private chats, and texting &lt;sic!&gt;. Books have not fully completed the transition into the digital world yet. Too rigid the software compared to paper – too tiresome the reading activity itself. Better display devices with higher resolution, higher refresh rates, or even electronic ink offer an experience of text that is as stable and legible as printed text on paper. However, a few issues remain: digital text is not spatially persistent. It always depends on the tool and the recent click or swipe activities how and where a paragraph is displayed. Hence it is a desperate attempt to look for a paragraph that was located somewhere on the upper third of a right page roughly after the introduction. Other interaction challenges are personal highlighting and annotations. Some propriety silo solutions are available. But none of them is as flexible as pencil scribbles on paper or as standardised and connected as the Web itself. None of the annotation solutions explores the realm of dynamically connecting people and media.<br>	Display quality gets better. Goggles get smaller and more ergonomic to wear for longer time periods. Lab experiments are being conducted to use contact lenses instead of clunky headsets Hopefully interface capabilities and usability for reading and annotating text and for text authoring tools will improve as well.<br>	Text in the really real life –  excluding the printed word and the digital domain for a moment – occurs in public urban spaces. Text IRL is used on highway signs, as street labels, signage on and in buildings, even as hints on doors – PUSH/PULL – not to bump your head. Text IRL is used on billboards; picture the neon marketing messages on Times Square or Piccadilly’s large urban displays, which blend into the digital world already. Text IRL has a purpose to inform the “users of RL” about certain features; for instance how to find your way in a city, or which coffee to order in a restaurant. Text IRL supports RL by delivering necessary or superfluous information to the inhabitants of the space.<br>	Text IRL without a function might be considered as art. There are a couple of examples for this category. Maybe graffiti? Maybe city branding campaigns like the letter sculptures<b> Iamsterdam</b>. Certainly urban word art which makes the pedestrians slow down and ponder the philosophical relation between letter sculptures and the location.<br>	These considerations are quite relevant for VR if you acknowledge that artificially created reality aims to mimic the real world until the scenery becomes indistinguishable and the sensational impression can be considered perfect. The real world is the primary metaphor of the virtual world until it passes a VR Turing Test.<br>	Virtual objects might stimulate our senses like their counterparts in the real world. Flipping through a virtual book might provide a sense of weight, haptics of paper, the sound of waving sheets, eventually even a fresh breeze of air or the smell of yellowed paper. A gesture with a finger is sufficient to flip (or scroll?) though the pages.<br>	Initially a new medium will embrace all content that has been created for prior generations of media technology until the characteristics become clear and evolve into a new medium of its own right. Hence it is no surprise that several Hollywood movies depict the future of VR in quite classical terms. Three movies stand out: In »Disclosure« [Barry Levinson, 1994; based on a novel by Michael Crichton, 1993] the VR user virtually walks through a virtual library and opens cabinets to look for specific documents in virtual folders. »Minority Report« [Steven Spielberg, 2002; John Underkoffler as a consultant for presumable user interface concepts] introduces hand gesture interaction on large curved screens to sift through a huge media library to find evidence. The user moves like a conductor in front of an orchestra to skim through image and video footage. Finally the »Matrix« trilogy in 4 parts [Lilly and Lana Wachowski, 1999-2021]: VR is indistinguishable from reality and the only perceived state of being. There are only a few glitches in the matrix that causes suspicion about his perceived reality for the hero Neo. {<i>»Follow the white rabbit,«</i> Naomi mumbles. At the periphery the scene from Matrix fades in.}<br>	All of these Hollywood interaction design video prototypes are impressive – that’s part of the success of the movies. But do they represent a usable and desirable concept for text in VR as well? It is more likely that VR will be a 3D TikTok horror show with billboards, subtitles, speech bubbles; more like massively multiplayer online games (MMOG) with plenty of targeted marketing messages. <br>	The cold text medium and the fairly hot VR medium do not fit together. The high definition environment will swamp any cold text medium that appears as a shy digital object. The virtual world offers so many attractions that the users cannot focus her attention on longer text blocks to read. The same is true for writing. Too many distractions provide a poor environment for sound reasoning or to create engaging stories.<br><br><h3 id="DA604B80-63C5-475D-B8B7-4C4F30269669">A Vision for Text in the Virtual World</h3><br><br>Like in the real world the environment matters for concentrated reading or creative writing. If anything is possible in VR, then dedicated 3D rooms should be designed and offered to support authors and readers. Interior designers might be involved to create cozy and calm rooms which display the corpus of text as primary digital objects. Related material is within reach. Significance can be mapped to distance. Filing and retrieval of documents should not simply mimic real library architecture where long and narrow aisles lead to sky-high book shelfs. In real life shelf space is a scarce resource. Space in VR is endless. Effective and efficient navigation structures are crucial in VR. The visual design of VR libraries shall not resemble the aesthetics of sci-fi movies. Instead some imagery of real and therefor familiar libraries might set the mood and expectations to interact with the collections. Mood images work like icons and labels and provide orientation to the user. Algorithmic magic shall augment and assist the user’s ability on browsing papers and connecting the dots for new creative conclusions. Interacting with resources should not be any simpler than the motto <i>»information at your fingertips.«</i> The action to offer more material or to visualise concepts in animated 3D graphics must only be a response to a clearly articulated wish of the user – such as the tip of a finger or a mumbled command. Otherwise the focus of attention is allured to different media.<br>	A new interaction language for gestures needs to be established. We’ve had mouse clicks and drag’n’drop for desktop WIMP systems (windows, icons, menus, pointing device). Swipe, pinch and tabs are finger gestures on mobile touch devices. <br>	Take the full body tracking from »Minority Report«. Any gesture can be interpreted to control the virtual environment. Raising an eye brow, nodding the head, shrugging the shoulders, conducting with both arms… The possibilities and degrees of freedom to trigger actions in the VR environment are tremendous. Therefore it is necessary to establish vendor-independent conventions how to interact and behave in VR. The systems will adapt to individual preferences and habits like they do today for speech recognition. A prediction model will always calculate the user’s intention based on the current context and be ready to offer related information on demand. Gentle micro feedback – visual, audible or haptic force feedback – tells the user about the responsive state of the system.<br><br><h3 id="75009AB7-CF25-4F91-B3A7-10CCB50227E2">Augmenting Human’s World</h3><br><br>Augmented reality (AR) will adopt the interaction paradigms from VR. In addition, an internal digital twin of the real space needs to be kept up-to-date. The AR experience might be more comfortable and satisfying than being in a VR world because the natural and therefore familiar environment is always present and can be used as a reference point and as a backdrop to superimpose digital text and other media. Real surfaces become interactive displays. Sticky notes become virtual sticky notes that can be placed on augmented surfaces or on virtual work spaces. <br>	Collaborating with other people in shared AR environments can also be a productive setting; less for writing text, but to inspect and create hovering models in space.<br>	Alan Kay shared an anecdote from times when he was a student at University of Utah in the mid 1960s. Alan and a class mate got the assignment to improve a Simula program. An endless paper printer has produced an almost endless printout of the program. They rolled out the paper “scroll” down a hallway. While crawling across the paper they shouted their findings to each other to understand the object-oriented principles of the programming language. (Later this experiences helped Alan Kay to shape Smalltalk) – The hallway scenario makes sense in VR or AR as well. An innovative approach would be to identify problems and scenarios (for dealing with text) that can be tackled easier in an infinite 3D space than with a windows environment or even on small mobile screens.<br>	Finally, the paper metaphor get less relevant. Typewriters are exhibited in museums. DTP (desktop publishing) word processing, electronic mail among other means to communication online are common practice for more than a generation. Reading and writing text on screen does not have to refer to the paper mataphor anymore. People grow up with swiping text on smart phones. Pupils and students are always connected on free wifi. Autocomplete is the preferred input method for virtual on-screen keyboards. Voice UI is used for home entertainment systems. Although, voice-to-text still has to been proofed as a viable input modality for longer texts.<br><h3 id="2DD6F6E5-B2EC-45D0-9B52-253D1C331E28">Provisions for the Future</h3><br><br>Josh Clark was concerned regarding “Natural User Interfaces” for touch devices. He said, <i>»We are creating the illusion that there is no user illusion anymore.«</i> <br>	We – as interaction designers – are diluting ourselves when we aim towards this objective for VR once again. There is always a conceptual design layer and a technical layer between the user and the service. Any usage is alway mediated by the artificial environment. It is the responsibility of product &amp; interaction designers to create solutions that meet the expectations and needs of the users to all regards.<br>	Gestalt laws and human physiognomy are universal and should not be ignored. User centred design for AR &amp; VR will have to find solutions that initially look and feel familiar even in 3D. Copying the real world can only be a first step. In the long run interaction paradigms of desktop and mobile will be extended to utilise virtual 3D world that is projected into a 360° sphere or augmented onto the real world. Free floating windows in space is merely a minimum viable solution. “Physical” motion and hole body gestures will be added to the interaction modes of mouse, multi-touch and voice. The virtual depth of VR can be used to create primary working areas, secondary side spaces and rooms in the vicinity for other resources or other primary activities. Rooms offer a specific set of actions. Rooms can be considered like apps today. Multi-user environments need to pay attention to privacy concerns in shared spaces. But they offer the opportunity for collaborative dynamic spaces to tackle wicket problems collectively.<br><br>{ Naomi moves two finger downwards followed by a thumbs up gesture.

Along with this burst of AI art generators harnessing text in a very functional way – as text-to-image crucibles – the corresponding wave of image synthesis is instigating a fresh reliance on, and examination of, the role of text itself as an imagination engine, with accompanying microstories proliferating alongside AI-genned imagery. With each update and/or subsequent jump in the innovations these AI art generators are providing creators, there’s a corresponding surge towards text exploration and experimentation especially in terms of explanation, description, and narrative manufacturing. Alongside these surges is the need to develop associated ethical guidelines and best use principles when using these text-prompted AI art generators, including rules for prompt engineers, and the moral - and potentially legal - minefields it provokes. This paper will trace such explorations, experimentations, and ethical considerations associated with the use of using such text-dependant AI art generators, while outlining the concepts involved in text-to-image synthesis and the process of text prompting through an examination of the AI-human collaboration ‘[Por]TrAIts: AI Characters + Their Microstories [Book One]’.<br><br><a href="https://mezbreeze.itch.io/portraits-volume-one">https://mezbreeze.itch.io/portraits-volume-one</a><br><b><br></b><h3 id="88D058B6-60E3-4D78-AE2C-B858C6471B21">Beginnings</h3><br><b><br></b>So it’s 1988 and I'm hungover and crouched over a desk half-heartedly watching my University lecturer give a talk about societal impacts and future trends. At one-stage the lecturer uses the term Cyberspace, a concept which at the time is new to me, but it gets my attention to the point where I'll later look up the term (when I'm less hungover) and have my tiny 17-year-old mind blown by what I find.<br>	Jump to 1994 and I'm sitting in an offwhite computer lab where a friend, a mechanical engineering student, is telling me all about the wonders of the Internet and the World Wide Web. After she leaves I dive full force into the guts of programs like Telnet, Fetch, and Mosaic: and thus begins my becoming hooked on the joys and terrors of the Internet and the World Wide Web.<br>	Jump again to the year 2022 and I am sitting in my studio listening to the founder of an Artificial Intelligence organisation who is currently onboarding us, a group of beta testers, who have been invited to test their AI image synthesis generator. This is not my introduction to AI Art generators which happened a few years prior, but it is still a pivotal moment where the true societal and cultural impacts of such technology start to manifest in my limited consciousness.<br>	In all three instances just described, each encounter can be viewed as a milestone regarding introductions to, and interactions with, technology that would (and will) proceed to shape our contemporary world for better and/or worse. Cyberspace, the Internet, XR and VR, and Artificial Intelligence have had (and will continue to have) explosive societal impacts. In terms of the cultural gravitas with which they should be viewed, just as the Internet has become inextricably embedded into the very fabric of humanity's relationship with technology, Artificial Intelligence in general – and the use of text in relation to the production of AI-generated artwork using text prompts specifically – holds the potential to critically impact industries, institutions, individuals, and societies at large.<br><br><h3 id="5D326F5C-4EC7-43DF-8757-97895ADC9F3C">The Stage</h3><br><b><br></b>Since April 2021 when OpenAI’s text-to-image generator DALL-E intro-splashed across the AI scene, AI Art generators have burst onto the ‘next-big-thing’ stage in spectacular fashion. If you’re a regular user of social media, it’s highly likely that you’ve recently (and regularly) been exposed to a stream of AI imagery shared by eager creators using text-to-image generators like DALL-E2, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, Craiyon, NightCafe Studio and Imagen who are keen to explore and in some cases unfortunately exploit such methods of producing visual output. Creators, developers, critics, academics and commodifiers all seem keen to jump on the AI Art bandwagon and hitch their fortunes to the next tsunami tech-wave. <br><br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><h3 id="4A73C3CA-5450-409B-9E72-0CD6BF48FB7A">The Lowdown</h3><b><br></b><br>Text-to-image AI Art generators are for the most part based on neural networks trained on massive datasets (some of which are scraped from the Internet itself) that produce output through Diffusion, a practice where images are produced effectively from randomness through a process involving image noising and denoising. Using text structures called prompts that contain a combination of descriptors, tokens, styles, punctuation, modifiers and concepts, the resulting visual outputs can mix the strangest combination of elements to produce unique results. Such image synthesis occurs out of what is termed a ‘Latent Space’ or a type of abstract, multi-dimensional limbo which contains visual potentialities dependent on the datasets used in the AI training which are almost ‘summonsed up’ from this space by a specific combination of words and punctuation.<br>	In the rush to embrace text-to-image generation, the term prompt engineers - used more broadly in machine learning - is now being co-opted to describe people using such text-to-image generators who craft such prompts. Prompt engineers deploy text in particular ways to direct their desired image output, with manipulation and experimentation playing a key role. This need to play with text and semantic structuring has fostered a fast-moving subcultural base, one that is gestating and evolving rapidly with digital spaces like Github, Hugging Face, Replicate and Google Colab being harnessed as playgrounds in which to test such experiments. Alongside the role that text takes in such explorations (that being one of an imagination engine), with each AI Art generator upgrade or modification like inpainting, outpainting and upscaling, the AI Art field becomes broader and more adventurous. Text-to-image adopters are also using text in novel ways alongside their generated AI Art, with a surge of poetic and fiction-based stories proliferating – AI Artists like Vladimir Alexeev and Dr Siobhán O’flynn have been using such AI output as the backbone of larger story-based projects. <br>	One such storytelling project I’ve been constructing since July this year is a book series based around text-to-image output. The first book in this series, [Por]TrAIts: AI Characters + Their Microstories [Book 1] is a collaborative effort between myself and the AI DALL-E2. The book is comprised of a fusion of AI generated portraits and microstories written in my signature English/code-hybrid language called Mezangelle, and was inspired by being invited by the OpenAI team&nbsp;to participate in their AI Artist Access Program (OpenAI being the organisation responsible for creating DALL-E2). This book can be accessed here: https://mezbreeze.itch.io/portraits-volume-one.<br><b><br></b><br><hr style="width:10%;"><h3 id="33F2B47B-D4D0-4743-B14F-1DE7448CD3F1">The Impact[s]</h3><b><br></b><br>Academics, artists, and non-artists of all stripes have begun to wade into debates concerning the legitimacy of text-to-image generated art, with a large percentage of the resulting dialogues veering predictably towards the hyperbolic. There are also valid concerns being expressed by certain societal sectors regarding the potential seismic cultural shifts that might well be associated with such AI tech, and although the term ‘disruptive’ has been ridiculously co-opted to represent anything even vaguely associated with non-standard use, I can’t really think of a more apt arena for true disruptive impact than AI text-to-image (and very soon text-to-video, text-to-animation, and text-to-game) generation. [Author Note: examples of how quickly AI generative fields are accelerating can be seen in the fact that in the three weeks since this paper was presented at the 2022 Future of Text Symposium, Google and Meta have both released new text-to-video generators and Microsoft has announced the inclusion of text-to-image AI Art generator into a new Office app called Microsoft Designer.]<br>	Just some of the creative industries and individuals likely to be heavily impacted by the growing use of AI Art generators include graphic design, concept artists, photography, illustration (storyboarders, cartoonists, plastic arts practitioners), film and video editors, curators, animators, game developers, and interactive storytellers. And this doesn’t even cover how AI will impact and is in fact right now affecting businesses like stock photo outlets, advertisers, and publishers. In fact, there’s already been several controversies surrounding the use of text-to-image generators, such as the furore over the Midjourney-crafted AI image that recently won a Colorado State Fair Digital Artwork Prize, and the disturbing report of real medical photos being included in datasets used to train AI image synthesis models. There’s also the fact that as of September 2022, Getty Images have banned any AI works from being uploaded or sold via their platforms.<br>	It's been extremely enlightening being involved in the both the DALL-E2 and Stable Diffusion Beta Testing programs: alongside the absolute wonder and delight in using such tech, seeing inbuilt implicit bias concerns arise has been less than ideal, as has problematic content leaning towards misogyny, hatespeech and racial stereotyping, as well as training sets (and even worse, beta testers themselves) perpetuating the myth of the 'great' male artist with some women-identifying artists and representations being relegated to muse status and/or male gaze fodder. But this is just the tip of the AI Art generation iceberg: other issues being raised over text-to-image art include legal ramifications regarding copyright, the ease of propaganda creation, and problems surrounding the datasets on which generators have been trained that include living artists work without any permissions or compensation given.<br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><h3 id="76713D9C-7ED1-48DA-BA04-344DDD761869">The Rules</h3><b><br></b><br>The development of crucial ethical guidelines and best use principles when using text-prompted AI Art generators, including rules for prompt engineers, can’t come soon enough. <br>Some ethical questions that might be considered when using such text-to-image generators include:<br>1.	When writing text prompts, do you absolutely need to include references to particular artists, living or deceased?<br>2.	If you must include artists in prompts, should you make sure to use a mix of many artists and styles, and preferably only included the names of deceased artists?<br>3.	Think long and hard about whether it is acceptable to use text-to-prompt generators for the creation or dissemination of hateful or harmful content.<br>4.	Consider if your text prompts replicate or emulate any overarching biases or lopsided power structures, and if they do, whether it is ok to a) use them in the creation of AI Art and b) to promote or publicise such images?<br>5.	Consider the implications of the long-term use of AI Art generators on our increasing Climate Emergency due to image synthesis being extremely computationally demanding.<br><br><h3 id="619F8F38-9A86-4578-96E8-2F3A2DD867C3">Conclusions</h3><b><br></b><br>Jumping back to that hungover morning in 1988, if I’d known then what I do now about the wide-ranging impact of Cyberspace and the Internet in general I’d probably have laughed and then sobbed, especially given the epistemic crisis humanity is currently facing due in part to the development and use of such technologies. Just as in the 1990’s I would never have been able to predict how impactful the Internet would become, it’s almost impossible to ascertain just how text-to-image AI Art generation will manifest in the future – but if we’ve learnt anything from the past (including the weaponisation/politicisation of text and media in relation to propaganda and political grandstanding) we’ll be wise to hardbake lessons learnt from such technologies into all aspects of AI Generation, including the textual nuances and moral considerations relevant in the construction of such imagery.<br><hr style="width:10%;"><br><br><h1 id="2E500ABA-E852-45B8-BD6E-E3FFB956D2AC">Michael Roberts</h1><br><br><center><h2 id="1BA16943-88B9-4381-8045-77BED950F5A7">Metaverse Combinators: digital tool strategies for the 2020’s and beyond</h2></center><b><center><br></center></b><br>For the last 30 or so years, one of the dominant paradigms in tools for making digital content has been the “node-code”, “flow-based programming” or “visual programming” style more accurately referred to as “node-based programming”.  <br>	In these tools, digital content is expressed by connecting together “nodes” into graphs using edges or “wires”, with this variant of programming being commonly known as “wiring”.  <br>Modern examples of the genre include Touch Designer†, the Maya Hypergraph†, PD†, Blueprints† and others.<br>	Example applications of this technology have ranged from shader editing all the way though to controlling high-level behavioral interactions, as would normally be performed using some sort of conventional scripting language, such as Lua or JavaScript.  Application areas are now extending to distributed network applications.  <br>	The tools typically exhibit much finer grain control of the “look and feel” of digital content than the current direction of using natural language input to “generate” AI-based art, which is disrupting the art content generation pipelines. They allow users to “tweak” on minor visual appearance properties in a way that is not currently possible with text input AI tools.  <br>	On the other hand, in AI tools “complexity is free”, meaning that users to not have to explicitly code or “make” it.  This paper attempts to analyze some of the potential interactions between these two, non-mutually exclusive, paradigms, as well as provide some “language” for discussing such relationships.<br><br><h3 id="E5B640DC-679F-4172-88BF-9068138D87AB">Programming using node-based languages</h3><b><br></b><br>Standing in contrast to conventional textual programming, node-based programming straddle the gap between so-called “real programming” using conventional textual languages (typed or untyped) and simple, typically database driven, configurations.  <br>	Node-based languages allow the user to use or combine small modules (or nodes) which express limited <i>behaviors</i> controlled by parameters (or properties).  The behaviors of the concert system expressed by such tools thus controlled by 3 elements: the selection of the nodes used; how the nodes are connected together (topology) and the properties of the nodes.  <br>	Nodes typically express “ports” which are used to connect to other nodes.  The act of “wiring” involves drag-and-drop type operations in which “wires” or “edges” are connected between the ports as well as the setting of properties for nodes using some sort of property editor.  <br>	In a 3D/VR, multimedia or a similar context, nodes can function as “media objects” – with high level properties such as “resource locators” that point the runtime system to load a mesh, character, sound, area of text, or other media object.  Likewise, lower-level surface appearance data, such as mesh textures, procedural geometry, height maps, etc., can all be expressed by graphs with appropriate runtime and node support.<br>	A variety of underlying implementation mechanisms have been used as execution engines for such graphs.  In the author’s current work, this engine is a parallel message passing virtual multicomputer, but other approaches have included compilation into machine code or intermediate representations such as SPIR-V†, conventional sequential textual languages, dataflow models, execution using function evaluation or, in the author’s 1989 work (Roberts &amp; Samwell, 1989) <a href="https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/28547/">(Roberts, 1990)</a>, compilation into a parallel programming language.<br><br><h3 id="A04B05D3-E886-404C-B866-990E39BE0AD7">Combinatorial thinking</h3><b><br></b><br>C<i>ombinators</i> are a higher-order functions that uses only function application and previously defined <i>combinators</i> to derive a result from supplied arguments.  <br>	Based on original work by Moses Schönfinkel and Haskell Curry in the early 20’s, combinators have found widespread application in functional programming though languages like Haskell†.  <br>	The essential idea behind combinators is that function state is bound into the function invocation using only bound variables (as opposed to free variables) – I.E., arguments to functions, and then functions are combined to end-results of arbitrary depth.  <br>	However, “constants”, such as “1” in a function declaration, can also be considered “state” when viewed though a certain lens (changing the function by changing the “constants”). Such splitting of hairs leads to a grey area between object-oriented and functional languages in which the act of editing a function definition can be regarded as “changing the state of an object” – analogous to the setting of properties on a node in a node-based language.  <br>	Similarly, the act of connecting nodes together with edges can also be regarded as combination – or the process of enumerating combinations or configurations of the smaller, simpler functions “contained” in the nodes.  We therefore use the term “combination” and use this to refer to the act of programming a node-based system via the connecting of various nodes together into a working system via wires and the setting of their properties.  <br>	Node-based languages are deeply combinatorial, as are other systems commonly in use for digital art, like painting programs.  Such programs define a “combinatorial space” which can be explored by users making digital artifacts – artists serve as navigators of such a space, making aesthetic choices and exploring pathways though the space defined by the tool that make sense both from a cultural perspective and also with their own sense of how things “should be”.<br><br><h3 id="B80A2357-B4D5-40D6-A0DF-DDD07B504D71">Meta tools</h3><b><br></b><br>Metaprogramming is generally held to be a programming technique in which computer programs have the ability to treat other programs as data.  It is a part of the genre of thinking which believes that tools should have the ability to make more, and higher-level, tools.  <br>	Traditional crafts have a notion of a “mother craft” or “fertile” tools.  These are toolsets and processes which can give rise to artifacts that can be used for the same or other applications.  Blacksmithing (the traditional craft concerned with forging metal) is one example.  Using a relatively simple set of underlying or “bootstrap” tools (hammer, tongs, forge and anvil), blacksmiths can forge all the tools they need to make both tools for their own use and also tools for other domains, such as farming, pottery, or even sewing.  Over their lifetime in the craft, blacksmiths typically accumulate large numbers of self-forged tools, ranging in application from simple to complex.  The entire western industrial revolution can be considered as emerging from this historical activity.<br>	The h-graph or “hierarchical” graph model used in some node-based languages holds one key to the development of such “fertile” tools in the visual domain.  In this representation, nodes and edges can conceptually be “wrapped up” into a higher-level object – itself a “node” – the composite behaves like a “primitive node” but is itself a compound object formed from the combination of multiple lower-level objects, in the same sense that we build modern software using libraries.  When such an object can, via component objects, make other objects, access/set their properties, and connect them in various different topologies, we have a true “metaprogramming” tool, in which we can write tools “in the tool” that themselves make things.  	The result is capable of <i>spawning complexity</i> and up leveling the functionality of the toolset – a “strange loop” in the sense of Hofstadter.   <br>	Making tools expands the combinatorial space defined by the original tool, leading to an entity that “grows” with time.<br><br><h3 id="84790C3E-C4D9-49C8-A6B5-B92480C5EC15">Information Hiding</h3><br><br>One of the key critiques of visual programming languages is that they “lead to mess” – detractors see a mass of “boxes connected with lines”, and it is true that many implementations of the paradigm do suffer from this fault.  Hence, visual programming applications that don’t implement “information hiding” force users to consider “all the nodes” at the same time – an overwhelming process give the large amount of bandwidth available in our visual system.   <br>	We think that the unreasonable effectiveness of textual programming is somewhat caused by the information hiding properties inherent in text – instead of navigating a large, complex structure “all at the same time”, good programmers wrap up their code into hierarchical pieces – classes, functions, and methods - which perform simple, well-defined operations that can be tested and reasoned about separately.  The motivation for this is probably related to the fact that we can only hold a relatively small number of concepts simultaneously (normally equated to 7 <a href="https://phys.org/news/2009-11-brain-magic.html">(Schenkman, 2009)</a>).  <br>	Given that the textual representation is “opaque”, textual programmers probably mainly navigate a mental model, informed by their reading of the text.  To be effective, visual programming systems must implement explicit “information hiding” mechanisms that allow users to flexibly consider sub-pieces of their program rather than the “whole”, which is outside comprehension parameters.<br><br><h3 id="7679DFB8-B063-4B03-84B0-2D4BED973626">Hyperparameters</h3><b><br></b><br>It is well known that adjacency matrices can be used to express graph structures.  Such matrix representations (with weights) are heavily used in deep learning systems, for example tensor-flow†.<br>	Similarly, individual low-level parameters, perhaps the properties in the nodes in the aforementioned systems can be encoded as “weights” in a much larger matrix structure representing the overall parameter space defined by the visual programming system.  The size and scale of these structures means that they are not readily comprehensible by humans because many of the information hiding properties from the previous section simple do not exist over this representation.  <br>Likewise, the scale of such a system can be heavily affected by the combinatorial nature of the node-based language, as well as additional parameters defining sum-of-linear function structures that appropriate potentially non-linear parameters inherent in the graph model.  We have thus come to a situation in which it is possible to encode the “program” in a visual or other content creation tool using a matrix representation which is almost completely opaque to a human overseer.  <br>	This is, in fact, exactly what tools like Midjourney† and Dali-E-2† do, but they approach it from the point of view of learning the structure (and thus hyperparameters) for such a representation though consideration of the output from such tools.  <br>	Once trained, such a structure cannot “grow” unless it is retrained on different input data, a limitation that reinforcement learning sidesteps, by constantly retraining itself by “playing a game and observing the results” with the domain it is working in.<br><br><h3 id="B328B6DF-A4EA-4865-A152-904A7EC2A6D8">Machine learning approaches</h3><b><br></b><br>Midjourney and Dali-E-2 create realistic images and “art” from descriptions phrased in natural language which are used to activate particular sets of hyperparameters inside a learned representation.  As such, they form part of the “future of text”.<br>In a short time period, these tools have become so prevalent in popular culture that we will skip over a more in-depth description of the process of using such tools, and merely point out several key take-aways.<br><li>Such tools leverage the computer graphics tool set built over the preceding 30 years, because they process (as input) imagery primarily generated using such tools.  The process of processing such images encodes properties of the images into a set of hyperparameters expressed in a neural network.</li><br><li>Likewise, they leverage and implicitly encode the individual process and techniques of artists who originally used the digital tools.  </li><br><li>Techniques for texturing, painting and other mechanisms, accessed by the artists, have explored a significant portion of the combinatorial space made possible by the original tools and thus the space over which the learning operate.  </li><br><li>AI cannot, at least conventionally, invent “new” space – it merely remixes and combines hyperparameters extracted from the combined original work of the artists.</li><br><li>Fine details – what would normally be referred to as “technique” in art or programmed for in a tool (such as surface appearance) is essentially “free” in such a model – users of the tool no longer have to make this fine level of detail.</li><br><li>Operating at this level, imagination is “constrained” by the textual navigation method. Consider that I imagine a cat – if I am drawing a cat, I am going to have a lot of latitude in how I represent the cat.  Some of this complexity (the sum of all possible input cat art) is expressed in the hyperparameter space of the AI model, but we currently lack the tools to navigate it, view it in any sort of totality, or really understand it’s nature.</li><br><li>Much of the conventional computer graphics pipeline, as exhibited by generations of SIGGRAPH papers, has focused on hand-encoded techniques for producing particular visual appearances. This pipeline, which encodes a lot of knowledge about process and performance, could potentially be obsoleted, if we move to a world in which “rendering engine output” is directly encoded neutrally, as pointed to by techniques like NERF <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934">(Mildenhall, Srinivasan, Tancik, Barron, Ramamoorthi, Ng, 2020)</a>.</li><br><br><h3 id="3BCB948D-292D-4A0A-A92F-789189C05E11">Moving forwards together</h3><b><br></b><br>It is tempting to look at the “AI art tsunami” and think that the sky is falling for conventional tools.  <br>However, some companies making tools, such as Adobe, are beginning to release products in which AI is used to augment more conventional digital content creation tools.<br>	If we choose to continue to represent content in ways that make sense from a cognition perspective for human beings, then these representations look a lot like the tools and processes that have gotten us to the point we are at now and which generations of people have thought about with a view to simplicity of representation.  <br>Instead of making AI tools which make remixed content from parsing the output from the conventional tools, why not begin to focus on making tools which learn into the common computer graphics representational stack and thus unlock the combinatorial power of human creativity?<br>	For example, rather than making a tool which synthesizes images directly, rather make tools which generate 3D models and surface descriptions suitable for use in conventional CG pipelines, surfacing control over such objects in the form of the node-based programming which countless technical artists are already familiar with.  Learning into such a representation also allows artists to “tweak” at the fine grain knobs and dials to obtain exactly the results they want, rather that accepting art “made” to quite a vague specification.<br>Such an effort clearly is not without difficulties – for example learning over complex parameter spaces of non-linear functions is a current open research problem.  However, the payback is that successive generation of tools writers both learn fundamental mechanics in the operation of their tool and have access to AI functionality that makes life easier.  <br>	The alternative, unfortunately, holds possibilities of a world in which the creative process that defines much of what we are as humans is progressively decoupled into the computer’s domain.<br><br><h3 id="D3EC4AFA-A7DF-4BFD-94A6-BA27BD4A0582">Conclusion</h3><b><br></b><br>We have tried to outline with a broad brush the productive area of synthesis between conventional node-based art tools, and the newer digital tools based on machine learning - both discussing the parameterized space over which all such tools work and drawing some conclusions about how to think about this space.  Finally, we have offered some suggestions for ongoing work in this space.<br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><br><br><h1 id="EAD2471D-05B8-4C1E-B128-9884AB142F5F">Omar Rizwan</h1><br><br><center><h2 id="8A415350-1343-4309-8C2D-4677DD1790B5">Journal: Against ‘text’</h2><br></center>ï¿¼<br><center><img id="1FA911CF-CC8D-4BE2-AD2C-FDA7036AA428" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/E7BA50A5-4D5A-4C06-977F-7EA81ED193D8.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><i><center>Figure 1. https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1300565745147863040.

I think that it comes with a lot of unhelpful baggage and connotations. When I start with ‘text’ as my basic concept, at some level, I’m starting with English prose, and alphabetic letters, and keyboards, and a rectangular screen or a piece of paper on a desk, and ‘plain text’ files†.<br>	Yes, you can say that 'text' also includes mathematical notation, or YouTube videos, or comics, or other writing systems, or any other media that humans have come up with, but I think that’s a sort of slippage. I think that if you articulate your goals in terms of text, you may pay lip service to all of those other forms, but you will always tend to treat them as exceptions and deviations from the norm. The picture in your mind will always start with the blank Word document or text file where you type some words in, and then you'll jam in some carve-outs to ‘embed’ everything else among the words†. Things other than words will always be second-class.<br>	My background is in computing, and in programming, and in trying to come up with new ways to interact with computers, and I think that computing has suffered very deeply from the centrality of text. Maybe that centrality was understandable, say, fifty years ago—computers were slow†, and text is relatively easy to store and process, after all. But today, our computers are more than capable of processing graphics and video and sound and other rich media, and I’m struck by how weak our tools still are when it comes to anything that isn’t text†.<br>ï¿¼ <center><img id="8758214C-E6B7-4FB0-8F51-6DE35E4F0403" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/B3FF0119-785F-4EB8-9E5E-350275A7B2A5.jpeg"></center><br><i><center>Figure 2. https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1351319206692868097.

The figures are the important part!† Text exerts this gravity, because it’s the container, it’s the norm. The text lives directly in the file you’re editing (and the figures live in separate ‘mage files’ outside it). You’re constantly (subconsciously) pushed to explain things with text, because it’s so much easier at a micro-interaction level to edit text than to add or change a ‘figure’†.<br>	(I think that this constant low-level push to use text is a way in which computing is a regression from paper—on a computer, it’s so easy† to produce and edit text that it dominates other†, richer, potentially more appropriate media. On a piece of paper, if you want to draw something in the middle of your prose, you can just draw it. Imagine if making these were as easy as typing:)<br>ï¿¼ <center><img id="FD4BC889-2559-4AC0-AA24-2AD8D3CDD20B" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/7A072BED-1A17-48C7-A802-B222EE4455AE.jpeg"></center><br><i><center>Figure 3. https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1201359487661223936.

I see it even when I have a bug or when I just want to know what’s going on with my program. It’s easy to log text, but it’s also so limited. What if I have a pile of data and I want a chart of it, not just summary statistics or random samples? What if I’m working in a domain (like designing a user interface, or drawing a map, or designing a building) that is inherently spatial and graphical? Yes, I can make a computer program that produces graphics, but it often feels† like ten times the effort† of producing text. Text is the default, and it’s a bad default.<br>	As you think about the future of media, I want to make the case that micro-interactions† will dominate over conceptual models and data structures. I think that how it feels is a lot more important than what the concepts are†. I think that people will gravitate toward interactions that feel† good and interactions that are immediately at hand.<br><br><center><img id="D6E54044-2F58-4754-9480-51CBD05FAC6E" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/EC945DB9-DCD4-4416-865E-B4B171862B95.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><i><center>Figure 5. https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1327901730235793411.

I believe that these little frictions and barriers are overwhelmingly important.<br>	I think that we live in a world that is dominated by systems that get the micro-interactions right. The iPhone, video games†, social media (scrolling† as a formative interaction†)…<br>	And I think that a lot of the power of ‘text’ on the computer is that it has some really great† interactions associated† with it (typing, selection, copy and paste, Unix tools, text editors, files…). Text has this manipulability and ‘open space’ nature†, a bit like the nature of files or of objects in the physical world. There are all these operations† you can do (and know how to do) to text. Part of this is built-up capital that already exists: the hardware capital that every computer has a keyboard, and the human capital that everyone knows how to use that keyboard. How can we get those kinds of interactions, that at-hand-ness, for other media?<br>	But that’s also why I don’t know if text has a future. What if the smartphone is the real personal computer in the end†? Then we have a future where the microphone and camera and multitouch surface, not text input, increasingly become the favored modes of interaction.<br>ï¿¼<br><center><img id="8121A265-68F6-4C10-B06C-E85C22692173" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/36F8798D-687E-48BF-BB78-C08A2F3B040F.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><i><center>Figure 6. https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1351377818769231875.

Initially, I had created a project called “Personal Taxonomies,” in which I was painting “Asemic” calligraphies based on Japanese, Mongolian, and Persian calligraphies, which were fed into a GAN on the <a href="http://futuretextpublishing.com/download/playform.io">playform.io</a> platform. The goal was to see if, given a large set of images, a form of “Digital Rorschach” by looking at the commonalities between all the images, based on Noam Chomsky’s notions of Deep Structures. If I fed a comparative machine learning engine based on finding patterns, could I find internal consistencies in my own cognitive/creative processes? I invite the reader to find my writings on this subject. For our purposes, this text is based on the author’s next step: visual concretism in prompt-based machine learning image generators, and the centrality of writing in the creation methods, and my aims for finding alterior spaces in Machine Learning’s latent image spaces as forms of concretized writing.  <br>&nbsp;<br><h3 id="F2FD43F2-2656-4C18-BD57-1E4E4069D19F">Context</h3><br><br>Since the beginning of 2022, when I started using NightCafé, I became very interested in the notion of text-prompted machine learning image generation.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;	The first foray into this was a visual poem, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w__O5luxZlQ">The Martin: for Negin</a>," which showed at last year's Electronic Literature Organization conference.&nbsp; I'm not afraid to say that it was a concrete animation of a poem I wrote for my wife and partner, Negin Ehtesabian, during our first time together in Baku, Azerbaijan, in 2018.&nbsp; I fed the poem into that particular engine, and with my voiceover and guitar improvisation, I created this specific work.<br>&nbsp;<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w__O5luxZlQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w__O5luxZlQ</a><br>&nbsp;<br>Because of its visual qualities, I found Night Café tedious in a short time.&nbsp; Next, I started working with Midjourney AI, which is probably one of the more middle-aged text-based AI programs, which now, I believe, is in its third version.&nbsp; It's a pay system with a well-established community and a wide set of tools to explore prompting.<br>&nbsp;<br><h3 id="914C4AB4-CCB9-4415-956D-93B4AC3E01D5">Content</h3><br><br>NOW, HERE IS WHERE I'M BEING A TERRIBLE WRITER – GETTING TO THE THESIS HERE, and maybe that's part of the point – working through visual narrative in AI is an indirect proposition. In talking with people like Ben Grosser, Marco Cadioli, Casey Reas, and Talan Memmott, there are several points that I would like to make about this form of imaging.<br>&nbsp;<br>1: This form of imaging is not about art making but writing.&nbsp; Prompt-based AI image generation is a concretization of syntax in the form of the prompt that the translator decodes.&nbsp; The differentiator then maps this interpretation to the latent space of however many billion or so images in the database.&nbsp; To be more precise, these practices are about exploring the latent image space through text as a form of index apparatus. As discussed later, that “index” can be a wide range of content.<br>&nbsp;<br>2: Machine learning-based image generation is undoubtedly a disruptive technology within the creative field, and its effects have unfolded in real time.&nbsp; Therefore, I will not be very prescriptive about it being art or not beyond my ideas on writing.<br>&nbsp;<br>3: My colleagues and I generally think that most of the work is derivative, often looking like something from an old Del Ray science-fiction novel book covers or photos shot through a small Funhouse mirror.&nbsp; In short, most of it is pretty terrible, leading to the next idea.<br>&nbsp;<br>4: I find the prompt-based image generation process manipulative or at least scopophilic in nature.&nbsp; I find it manipulative when one types a prompt with certain flags, etc., giving them something back that resembles the subject entered, thus making them somehow feel intelligent for “controlling” an indeterminately large post-photographic AI apparatus to do something they want.&nbsp;The result is a subject that the user more or less "expects ,”&nbsp;therein being the manipulation.  The prompt-response loop leads me to scopophilia in that the result gives a minor rush of visual excitement, pushing the user to go back and refine their prose.<br>&nbsp;<br>5: From talking with Ben Grosser, this is where it gets strange.&nbsp; Considering cybernetics and human-computer evolution, the human being would challenge the machine to improve and therefore have the human being strive to improve.&nbsp; This is Douglas Engelbart's notion of the Augment or human-computer co-evolution.&nbsp; But this is not what is happening. Quite the opposite.<br>&nbsp;<br>6: With prompt-based machine learning image generation, the paradigm is flipped.&nbsp; The algorithm is training the human to adapt itself so that the algorithm can give the human something that it finds more acceptable, pleasurable, and so on.&nbsp; In short, we have computer–human evolution, in which neoliberal technocratic systems explicitly program, inscribe, and evolve their aesthetics and poetics onto the user.<br>&nbsp;<br>7: Let's face it; artists like to break things.&nbsp; I have been trying to do something with my machine learning work over the last six months:<br> 7a: I have been trying to find unusual prompts that give highly unexpected results and gently move them into place.&nbsp; An example of this is my cyber/steampunk, biomorphic assault tank with big, fuzzy cat ears. Aleatorism to provoke surprising results is equivalent to trying to see what's behind the curtain. One does this using a tightly constrained set of prompts to explore usually unseen quadrants of the latent space.<br> 7b: This is used in tandem with the machine learning system’s adapting itself to the user's set of prompts so that the modulation of my text is dynamic in coordination with the feedback received from the machine learning engine.&nbsp; This subtlety is fascinating.<br> 7c: With my deep ties to the Fluxus movement, I'm also trying to see what element of the improvisational is in this process.

The main takeaway here is that a VR Environment need not simply mirror the three dimensions of our real world, presenting a First Person Shooter like representation of real or stylized spaces (which we can call Architectural Spaces), but can instead directly render datasets containing more than three dimensions, or attributes if you prefer.<br>	This can be achieved in an intelligible fashion by presenting a series of “slices” of our higher dimensional objects, in which arbitary object attributes are mapped, three at a time, to our familair X, Y, and Z axes. Since multiple objects might share these three attributes, an occupied point in our initial space can be thought of as holding the entire Result Set of querying our database for all entries that share those three values of those three attributes.<br>	Attributes that we choose to represent positionally in terms of the axes in a visualization can be said to be Extrinsic. Whereas, any additional attributes whose values we indicate with say shape or color or brightness or opacity of an occupied point are said to be Intrinsic.<br>	Each axis can be said to represent an extrinsic dimension that can correspond to an attribute or property of the objects in our dataset. How the values of attributes are mapped to points along an axis allows us to classify the kind of dimension that attribute represents.<br>	Wexelbart posits that there are two kinds of dimensions Absolue and Relative (Wexelblat, 1991). <br>	An object’s position along an Absolute Dimension is directly controlled by the scaled mapping of the values of one or more of its properites to that dimension.<br>	The location of objects along a Relative Dimension are determined by making pairwise comparisions of all entries using an ordering relation like greater than or after without necessarily knowing exact values for the attribute in question. Since multiple objects may satisfy a given ordering constraint it is possible for them to overlap, making any visualization of edges connecting such nodes unintelligible, unless one or more extra orthogonal (i.e. set at 90 degrees to the other axes) spacer dimensions are introduced so we can spread overlapping points out to view them and their connections individually.<br>	Since a Relative Dimension corresponds to a relation between elements we can subclassify it based on the properties of that relation.<br> 	Here we are concerned with the mathematical property of transitivity, which is to say whether the relation’s holding between an element and a second element, and the same relation’s holding between the second element and a third element, implies that that it also holds between the first element and the third element. If this is the case, we can conclude that the relation describes an acyclic graph so there will be no cycles among elements and the that the relation can be represented in Euclidean Space. If a relation is not transitive, it may describe a general graph containing cycles — as in the case of the winning relation in Rock, Paper, Scisors which loops around on itself with Rock beating Scisors, Scisors beating Paper, and Paper breating Rock. Such relations can’t be represented in Euclidean Space since moving far enough in one direction causes one to loop around to one’s starting point. This can of course be represented in one dimension by cutting the loops and stretching it out in a line and then “warping” from one edge back to the other — as in early Video Games where exiting the screen on the right side would cause one to re-enter it from the left or by duplicating a point at opposite ends of the display range or only drawing its right half up against the left edge of the screen and its left half up against the right edge of the screen.<br>	Alternatively a graph relation can be represented From the Outside by embedding it in a 2-D or 3-D Space. General Graphs can be represented in 2-D by drawing their verticies as points at arbitrary locations and connecting them with potentially crossing lines called edges or in same manner in 3-D without any overlapping edges.<br>	We can visualize a Non-Euclean Geometry From the Inside where all Three dimensions in a volume might represent non-transitive relations, in which case the six faces exiting a unit cube are logically glued together in one of a number of possible configurations mapping pairs of faces under possible rotation called manifolds.<br>	But rather than viewing the relations captured in such unnatural spaces From the Inside, it is much easier to visualize them From the Outside as traditional graphs in a 3-D volume.<br>	If the comparison relation underlying a relative dimension is dervied from values, such that we can determine relative distances between pairs of points in the space, we can compress the dimension based on these values and space points to preserve the degree of differnce between pairs — spacing points relative to the greatest distance between points in the set of all pairs relative to the minimal distance between the points in such pairs; otherwise we can simply give them a uniform spacing.<br>	Alternatively, in dealing with absolute dimensions we can place points at their natural locations along the dimensions and then compress or fold the space to collapse large empty regions while adjusing axis labels to reflect this non-uniform metric. We can call all of these sorts of presentations Elastic Spaces as they will be expanded or contracted based on the density of their contents to make optimal usage of available screen realestate.<br>	We can also classify dimenions based on the type of values they can represent and how many points they can contain.<br> <br><h3 id="84944F25-CEC9-4976-A233-556920A3D4E6">Wexelblat’s Taxonomy of Dimensions</h3><br><br><h4 id="6A4F0923-6E3D-40EA-B438-8643032C07D7">Linnear Dimensions</h4><br>A linnear dimension will corespond to the set of Real Numbers expanding in both directions from an origin to hold an uncountably infinite number of points. It can also be thought of in terms of the output from a grammar containing repeatable productions that can generate an arbitrary number of strings whose lexical order will place them between any two other strings generated by that grammer. In other words, any grammar that can produce infinitiely subdivisible or refinable lists! The Grammar describing the representation of Real Numbers (where we can generate 1.5 which sorts between 1 and 2, and 1.25 which sorts between 1 and 1.5, and so on up to infinitity)  falls in this class.<br><br><h4 id="C6334791-0A5A-4A6B-8342-7F1DA867FD7D">Ray Dimensions</h4><br>A ray dimension is also uncountably infinite, but will be bounded by an origin at some point on the number line and extend in only one direction to positive or negative infinity. The sets of Positive and Negative real numbers fall in this class as well as Age and Weight properties along with the output of a grammar describing Ted Nelson’s Tumblers (which can be refined with new dot delimited sub-sequences).<br><br><h4 id="C83F175E-6533-45F6-9AD4-1398C731D6F8">Quantum Dimensions</h4><br>A Quantum Dimension is most similar to a linear dimension but holds only values that can be mapped to the Countably Infinite set of Integers, making the space granular with no subdivisions of “cells” being possible. Whole Numbers, Natural Numbers, Prime Numbers, and arbitrarily long strings drawn from a fixed alphabet of sysmbols that are sorted by length have this property, as do any sets drawn from a fixed pool of possible elements.<br><br><h4 id="9A25C354-65A2-4777-BF38-3E4F66E2FEB3">Nominal Dimensions</h4><br>A Nominal Dimension is a Quantum Dimension that has been constrained by Domain Knowledge such as the Names of Employees as opposed to a grammatical notion of Possible Names in the abstract. This corresonds to the invokation of a Semantic Predicate like “Previously Defined” in a Parsing Expression Grammar which might consult a look-up table to reject syntactically valid inputs that haven’t yet been declared to be recognizable.<br><br><h4 id="F5DA408C-681E-40FF-8066-14A739D71572">Ordinal Dimensions</h4><br>An Ordinal Dimension may have up to a Countably Infinite number of members and can be thought of as being an ordered set or more generally a list that might contain multiple copies of any given element (as opposed to having an element composed of multiple copies of a given symbol — e.g. the list of elements [ ‘a’,  ‘a’,  ‘b’,  ‘a’ ] vs. the element ‘aaba’) in a fixed sequence, such that we can query the first, second, third, or fourth element; or determine that element ‘a’ recurs three times in the a list as its first, second, AND third elements.<br><br><h3 id="FDC324C0-B5AB-4F81-A6A9-662FE1DDF558">Functional Dimensions</h3><br><br>Here Wexelblat would place all attributes defined by complex forumulae whose values are subject to change, presuming their evaluation “at run time” as computer programmers would say. This aspect of the taxonomy seems a bit at odds with the others since the values generated at visualization time would be ammenable to classification under one of the other categories in his Taxonomy. So a Functional dimension is perhaps better thought of as an Aspect or Modifer of one of a core dimension type; or as being analog to the function of the Volatile keyword in the C Programming Language.<br>	The other weakness of this categorization is that it tends to conflate the Name of the Method, its Type Signature (i.e. what kinds of data objects it expects as inputs and what kind of value it produces) which might vary across data object (in which case the dimension would be most properly understood as representing / holding a Multimethod in Programming Language Design parlance), its Implementation(s), and the results of its Application to the dataset being visualized.<br>	It is unlikely that average system users would be concerned with the internals of the functions represented, so in a practical system having gobaly unique function names bound to code objects (holding their actual implementation code as an intrinsic attribute) would probably make the most sense. Alternately, we might be concerned with whether data objects support the invocation of a given method (e.g. Which data objects have a notion of “local time”?); how that value is computed (e.g. By querying a nearby time-server and returning its result vs. looking up Grenwhich Mean Time from its office time-server and then applying a local time-zone offset adjustment); or its current value (i.e. running the code to get its final value).<br><br><h3 id="F4E0928F-5DB0-4A55-A177-DF384992AF94">Visualizing, Editing, and Navigating Benediktine Cyberspaces</h3><br><br><h4 id="4BACBE9C-5613-45D9-A0C1-D34FD596D7D1">Visualization</h4><br>A system for working with a Benediktine Cyberspace will be a hardware/software amalgam called a Cyberdeck. On activating one’s Cyerdeck, one will be presented with a menu of pre-defined visualizations like “Peter’s Personal Library” as well as the option to create a new visualization, which would walk one through a set of dialogs to select a dataset or datasets of interest, which could be inspected to select one or more dimensions of interest and to describe how to map them to 3 extrinsic dimensions plus optional intrinsc dimensions. The final result will be a fully specified volumetric visualization called a Chamber or Space. <br>	At this point we can assume that even smooth linnear dimensions will be quanticized for display purposes, so each mathematical point in 3-space represented in the visualization will be mapped to one or more logical pixels on the display which taken together will constitute a Cell in the cyberspace containing one or more display space Voxels (ie. Volumetric Pixels).<br> 	Each cell can be colored to represent up to three intrinsic dimensions or we can scale the visualization to increase each logical cell’s physical voxel count enough for it hold an arbitrarily large nested sub-visualization that might take the form of a simple stylized 3-D shape, a compact block of line-wrapped text, a 2-D image, an arbitrarily detailed 3-D model, or a nested visualization in which the walls of the cell might even be treated as independent 2-D display surfaces (in which case a spin affordance would let one rotate the cell around to see its hidden exterior faces).<br><br><h4 id="9DB14D66-99B8-439C-BE30-E3F08F25B7A5">Editing</h4><br>Where a cell contains only a single data object, a grab affordance can be provided through which the user can take hold of the object within the cell and drag it relative to the visualization’s extrinsic dimensions to update the attribute values of the selected object, (e.g. dragging a timeline item update its start date attribute). When several items are present within a cell, a modifier affordance should a allow a user to select All or SOME of the data objects within the cell for a grab and drag to update operation.<br>	Regardless of whether a cell contains any data objects, it can be regarded as holding a Cursor or Probe into the data-space, such that a new operation could be invoked with the cell selected to create a new data object with that object’s attributes to which the visualization’s extrinsic dimensions are mapped automatically set to those values of the currently selected cell.<br><br><h4 id="4EB575BD-CE76-454E-8E14-8FF5372ADB14">Navigation</h4><br>As alluded to above, Chambers can be nested to hold linked visualizations, or they be can entered zooming in or crossfading to visually replace the current top level visualization with the one contained in the selected point, or they can be unfolded to create a dynamically linked top-level sibling or nested child visualization of a chamber holding the cell’s content bound to a different set of extrisic and intrinsic attributes. When a point is unfolded to open a linked visualization within the volume of its parent chamber, we call the resulting nested chamber/cell a Subspace.<br>	There is a certain level of terminological ambiguity in the use of the terms Cell, Chamber, and Subspace with Chamber generally being use in the case of top level visualizations whilest cells can refer to subvolumes or subvisulizations.<br>	Unfolding can be applied to one or more data objects to look inside of them, or to a Probe (conventionally represetned as 3-D cross-hairs) to look at the result set returned by treating it as a Query By Example. Dragging a Probe that has been unfolded around in its orgin space, will have the effect of scrubbing (in video editing parlance) through the result sets returned by dyaamically updating the Probe’s attribute query values (based on its extrinic location in its origin space) to dynamically update the contents of any nested or unfoled linked visualizations!<br>	In VR, these linked visualizations could be seperately positional by dragging them around in the virtual environment, with perhaps glowing 3-D Bezier Curves sweeping out behind them to maintain a visual connection to their cell of origin.<br><br><h3 id="57272715-1FBA-4BCE-A3BB-B4F0FCA25CCD">Comparing Objects</h3><br><br>In his chapter, Benedikt offers a brief taxonomy of how pairs of objects can be compared both within and across chambers/cells (Michael, 1991). If two objects share the same values for both their extrinsic and intrinsic dimensions in one or more (assuming we are dealing with mutliple copies of the same top-level chamber with independent probes and sub-spaces) chambers/cells they are said to be Self-Same (i.e. the same underlying entity in the dataset). <br>	If they share the same intrinsic attributes and the same values for them, but occupy different extrinsic coordinates within the same extrinsic dimensions, they are said to be identical. If they occupy different coordinates within the same extrinsic dimensions and share the same intrinsic dimensions but with different values, they are similar; but if they don’t share the same intrinsic dimensions we say that they are different. This roughly corresponds to notions of class membership in Object Oriented Programming. <br>	If objects in spaces with different extrinsic dimensions are compared and found to share both the same set of intrinsic dimensions and the same values for each of them, they are said to be super-identical. If they share the same intinsic dimensions but with different values for them, we say they are super-similar. However if they don’t share the same intrinsic dimensions we say they are wholly different. <br>	These relationships are a function of both the objects in our dataset and our choice of how we map their attributes to intrinsic and extrinics dimensions. So the same two objects might be similar in one representation and super-similar in another. <br>	If an object is dragable within a dataspace such that its extrinsic coordinates are othogonal to its instrinsic dimensions and their values, the object is said to have self-identity. If its intrinsic dimensions are preserved with movement, but their values are computationally bound to its extrinsic coordinates it is said to have self-similarity. If movement determines its set of intrinsic dimensions, it is said to have a strange identity. <br>	As crazy as this might sound, it can be practically applied in a user interface where placing an object in a designated region changes its class / prototype as can be accomplished via adornment actions† and smart adornments† in Tinderbox Map Views† (Note that on a deep level all notes within a Tinderbox document are similar in that they share a single global set of potentially instantiated attributes/intrinsic dimensions).<br><br><h3 id="FE478728-6BCB-4425-920F-909C4604AED8">The DataProbe HUD — An Additional Possiblity in VR</h3><br><br>It addition to the aformentioned visualizations, we can also imagine providing a VR user with a DataProbe HUD that would have a set of 2-D or 3-D virtual display panel slots that would remain at fixed positions (relative to a user’s head or external environment — depending on user preference) to display visualizations of slices of attributes of the cyberspace cell being looked at, as determined by eye tracking. <br>	For example, one might have an employee visualization depicting the faces of everyone in the shipping department and use HUD slots to show the full name, age, rating, and accumulated vacation days of whichever face one was looking at. Or one might be looking at a textual list of deparments and have a HUD Slot hold a 3-D overview of all of the departments by employee count, budget, and revenue with the cell correspoding to the name one was looking at light up in the HUD to give a perhiperal sense of how it relates to other departments. <br>	An inward swiping gesture could swap the main visualization for one in the HUD or vice versa with an outward swipe!<br><br><h3 id="01D4D6E2-74BD-40B6-926C-83512B256300">Future Work</h3><br><br>Considerable work remains to be done in cleaning up the nomenclature associated with Benediktine Cyberspaces.

We can visualize our mental processes, reflect on them and even rearrange them spatially to make connections between our ideas or separate different concepts.  In addition, by extending our thinking processes externally, others can join our shared space and help us to reflect and move on with our thinking.  Many modern tools allow us to visualize our collaborators and co-create by sharing the same space.</li><br><br>The next question comes when we imagine how to collaborate with an artificial intelligent agent in a shared space. What happens when an AI agent can respond across a shared spatial canvas rather than only continue what we are writing in one direction?  We may be able to ask an AI agent to combine different thoughts filling our empty canvas with some ideas to help us overcome our creative block. <br><br>Then, we'll become curators of AI-produced content, rather than focusing on the creation itself. We can imagine ourselves providing possible directions and letting these AI tools be in charge of transforming, organizing, and making connections between our ideas. In that future, we become the <b>conductors</b> of an orchestra of agents that write following our orders.â€¨<br><li>Discovering new fundamental operations on text with LLMs: When we analyze a tool like Fermat under Engelbart's H-LAM/T System one stops at the "M" (Methodology) and wonders. I always refer to the handwritten long-division algorithm used at schools to explain the "M" in the acronym - it's a good example, for it shows how mathematical notation augments us, how pen &amp; paper augments us, and it definitely needs some training to use, completing the system under the H-LAM/T lens. In our exploration (using Fermat) we can very cheaply play with Large Language Models (LLMs) and, in doing so, create complex prompt engineering or specific tasks and abstract them away in atomic UI elements like buttons: one for summarizing a text, another that generates counter-arguments from a statement, or propose creative solutions for a problem. After imbuing our digital workspaces with these AI-enabled buttons, the user starts using them as <b>new</b> <b>fundamental operations on text</b>. Where one previously would cut &amp; paste or find &amp; replace, now the user can summarize or criticize a text automatically, extract relevant keywords, generate counter-arguments, generate more ideas… in less than a second, which makes these (complex) actions feel like automatisms - in other words: new Methodologies for working with digital text under the lens of Engelbart's H-LAM/T.</li><br><br><h1 id="0E059F04-0F86-4DDB-86D7-C8E07517F5C2">Sam Brooker</h1><br><br><center><h2 id="BFA1DD86-389E-4F5B-896F-EE5B26DF0338">Supplementary Material: Devaluing the Work and Elevating the Worker</h2></center><b><center><br></center></b><br>Early hypertext scholarship recognised the power of the book as both object and artefact, its physical stability and defined boundaries asserting the personhood of the writer. “Each author produces something unique and identifiable as property” as George Landow <a href="http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=u_NFngEACAAJ">(Delany &amp; Landow, 1994)</a> put it, while Espen Aarseth described boundaries between literary works as a cultural construct, a product of print media <a href="http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=IxMKcd7tYg4C">(Landow &amp; Landow, 1994)</a>. Whatever the disadvantages of the print work, it at least ensured that there was an object to be traded. <br>	The value chain for publishing has historically been comparatively stable, if not always advantageous to the individual writer seeking to make a living. Releasing one-off works has always required the cultivation of a complex network of engaged, motivated individuals keen to access them. This structure of distribution is very labour-intensive, however, and reliant on a willingness to wait (sometimes for years) for a work to be released. An advantage of the historical publishing value chain is that publishers themselves can (at least in principle) apply the tools of marketing and promotion to maintain audiences and build anticipation prior to release. They can also (again, in principle) sustain a writer during periods of development and research. <br>	Web-oriented models of distribution offer a compelling answer to some historical problems of distribution. The infrastructure it provides promises that works can reach an audience without the material costs of a traditional publisher – see its value for writers of <i>Twine </i>fiction, for example, who were able to easily distribute their works online. <br>	Two related questions emerge from this new publishing environment: how best to maintain those value-adding networks necessary for commercial success, and how to ensure that creative people can make a living from them. “A very small number of authors gained visibility during this period”, wrote merritt kopas <a href="http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=4sjPsgEACAAJ">(Kopas, 2015)</a> of the <i>Twine </i>community’s<i> </i>most active period,<i> </i>“and almost all of them still struggle with material insecurity.” Alison Harvey too notes that <i>Twine</i>’s emancipatory potential, its much-discussed facility to amplify marginalised voices, does not provide “an adequate answer to the problem of creating a sustainable life for these game makers.”<br>	“Individuals could now no longer count on the support of their employers,” wrote Fred Turner <a href="http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=2SNFpgX_WigC">(Turner, 2010)</a>, of the world envisioned by Silicon Valley in the 1990s. “They would instead have to become entrepreneurs.” In the convergent, Transmedia space of the web some might argue that the tools for promotion and commercial success are already in place. An interlocking complex of platforms – Twitter, Patreon, YouTube, Twitch – provides the creative individual with the necessary tools to create and sustain a bespoke value chain which can support their working life. If Transmedia is “a collection of different segments of content that are brought together into a whole larger than any individual segment” <a href="http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=JRojy3YsdLYC">(Evans, 2011)</a> then this may offer the creator a means to cultivate such a following. Comedian Brian Limond found initial success through a largely self-produced comedy series on BBC Scotland, but now dedicates his time to the community he has cultivated on Twitch. <br>	Ultimately this pattern may invert the standard order of an audience’s relation with writers and their work.<b> Rather than curiosity about the person being prompted by interest in their output, the relationship is with the person themselves.</b> Works become manifestations of an identity or personality which audiences recognise through various social channels. By exposure audiences increasingly seem to engage more readily with social media content than the ostensible “work” of the individual. <b>Young creatives shift their self-identification of employment from </b><b><i>medium</i></b><b> – filmmaker, writer – to either oblique descriptions of personality or medium-agnostic terms like </b><b><i>content creator.</i></b><i><br></i>	Academic communities have been slow to respond to this change. An artefact-oriented media culture that fetishizes objects still prevails in many critical environments - even as wider cultural attitudes shift from an emphasis on the <i>work</i> to the persona of the <i>worker</i>. Are we really experiencing a fuller inversion of text and context, a perhaps natural evolution of poststructuralist ideas? Do audiences increasingly see the <i>creator</i> as locus of enquiry, their output valuable mostly as explanatory of person or endorsed as a means of supporting what amounts to a favoured stranger’s hobby? What might happen if we move more fully from a text-oriented culture to a context-oriented one? <br>	What does this mean for the writer? There are certainly advantages to making the worker, not the work, the locus of attention. An intimate, personal relationship with the creator, one that fosters a small but highly motivated audience, may sustain work that would be unlikely to find wider appeal. The need to sell thousands of units becomes irrelevant when the wider infrastructure costs are so comparatively low. Value networks that do not scale may work at the level of the indie content creator. <br>	And of course, there are disadvantages. Publishers, recognising this phenomenon and under significant financial pressure themselves, increasingly expect writers to bring the <i>audience</i> as well as the <i>work</i>. Time-poor individuals with limited resources, already struggling to complete creative work, now must maintain a complex, coherent identity across a plurality of social media platforms. Access to well-funded and well-connected networks will still permit advantaged individuals to get ahead, while those from less privileged backgrounds struggle to make themselves heard over the noise. A reorientation away from the object may also render the “real” work – the book, the film - a benign hobby tolerated by an audience there to engage primarily with the persona of the individual. Building an audience imputes an instrumentalist view of social interaction, encouraging performative activity which may act against our instinct toward truth and authenticity. Such parasocial relationships have consequences for audiences as well, particularly in their deepening connection with a creator whom they are unlikely to ever meet. <br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><br><h1 id="93B5C209-82AF-4C21-8FC3-4DA9A3F99A45">Scott Rettberg</h1><br><br><center><h2 id="E0639C8C-E549-4566-A377-225972FBB84A">Cyborg Authorship: Humans Writing with AI</h2><br></center><br>2022 is AI Spring: new very large language models are exploding exponentially, lending AI such as GPT-3 and its various successors and competitors increasing power to replicate and respond to human language as active cognizers, producing writing that is becoming nearly indistinguishable from human-authored text. <br><br>At the same time text-to-image programs such as DAL-E 2, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and others are enabling new acts of interlocution and image production. At the same time more conventional modes of computational narrative systems are being used by electronic literature authors in the process of authoring books that engage with algorithms along with human-authored language and structures. In this paper I’ll explore what these systems mean for human authorship and consider examples of how some authors are working with AI in creating narratives that are neither solely the product of human consciousness nor AI but the product of a hybrid process – cyborg authorship.<br><hr style="width:10%;"><br><h1 id="436360DB-1988-48F0-A70B-9211B9F085B4">Timur Schukin</h1><br><br><center><h2 id="B58F0A6B-F842-4BF5-B69F-B2CB363E3829">Multidimensional</h2><br></center><br>There is a new book by Slavoy Zizek that is called “Hegel in a connected mind”. He is talking to Elon Musk exploring and bringing his idea of direct thought to thought brain interface. He does that on the basis of his understanding of how ideas and text are related. That is not just his but Hegel’s and is basically mine as well, as the same ideas underlie Vigotskinian psychology, which is basically the main line in Russia, Ukraine and many other ex-USSR countries. He says that text is not just an artifact of thought–a ‘hardcopy’ of mind’s ‘softcopy’. <br>	The basic ideas is that text, not language, shapes thought. Without text one can not think, one needs to find words to make ideas clear and defined. <br>	Ideas’ own realm is imagination’s realm which does not provide the tools of symbol operations which text provides. So one needs to put his or her ideas to words and to text to really think in a way that has prominence.&nbsp;<br>	There is an old Russian approach to classification of professions that puts them in several categories. One is human to human, other is human to technology and another one is human to text. <br>	If one looks at VR and AR tech they seem to be build around two scenarios of interaction - these are human to tech and human to human, and when you see human to text - they are also built on other two approaches, they are not real human to text environments. â€¨	Also we can bring into consideration Marshall McLuhan’s approach to media and big epochs of media, where we had text environments before electricity and now we are entering digital. What he says in his laws of media is that media is transforming our literacy and changes collective subconsciousness in many ways, they suppress something and they retrieve old media. Digital retrieves scribal, the epoch when texts were human written, not printed.&nbsp;<br>	Bringing these three contexts together, one on relation of ideation and text, one on special kind of relations between human and text and one of Mcluhan, one can arrive at a few statements about all those placed inside an extended and controlled environment. <br>	I would say that its embodiment context comes from space understood in a limited way. Space of text is a space of thought and  aspace of conceptualisation, strongly connected to a space of imagination. Mcluhan says that text is a medium that works with unconsciousness and implements it’s workings on a massive culture-wide scale. And the human to text type of professions are based on idea of interfaces between text and human mind that are not equal to interfaces between body and it’s environment or it’s technical extensions. â€¨	Text is linear and its makes thought transform and shape itself when graph-like, network based ideation coalesces into trains of words. These transformation between multidimensional thought space and two or three dimensional text space that consists of symbolic representation of un-dimensional reality is a concept-creating space. <br>	There are many ontologies which shape the attention filters for objects in question–which are described by text. Most of those ontologies evolved during time which has passed since times Engelbart invented his engine. Now we can bring new inference logics and structures to ideation and representation spaces–system, thermodynamics, active inference, bayesian logic, quantum models and many others, most of them are already implemented in one or other kind of artificial agency algorithms. New structural relations between concepts, inferences and models, concept evolution and implementations practices are made into technologies, assistant algorithms and methodologies–all of which can be implemented in a new set of operators, surpassing copy–paste uplink–downlink etc models of Engelbart. <br>	They require a new multidimensional space and interfaces to be fully and user-friendly implemented. So I see VR and AR for text work as a new environment that which with ideas in forms of their brain-like diffuse and irrational multidimensional representations with it’s own, probably partly brain–computer interface enabled tech. Also text-hypertext editing tools as well as tools that can model and represent the object of text–physical or ideal. At the same VR space, with a completely new set of instruments for different levels and types of consciousness and cognition–working together as a whole augmented by agent–like instruments, which make that new kind of text work more of complex assemblage collaboration than just human–tool extension.&nbsp;<br><br><h1 id="AB1A8DC1-E06A-4754-A814-D2F4A87B8B2A">Yiliu Shen-Burke</h1><br><br><center><h2 id="EB44D9EB-28C5-4C62-8A41-C3EC446ADF89">Introducing Softspace.

They don’t let us see enough of the puzzle at once, and the way they show information makes remembering or reasoning about it difficult when it’s out of view—which is most of the time.<br>	Spatial computing offers a solution. XR headsets let us see, remember, and think about far more information than before, by displaying it in immersive 3D. This may be a new paradigm for software, but it’s one to which our brains and bodies are exceedingly well-adapted.<br><br><h4 id="BC834EDA-EADB-42E5-B314-6273B733945E">Softspace</h4><b><br></b><br>Softspace is an XR productivity and creativity app that gives creative knowledge workers a powerful new way to organize, develop, and communicate great ideas.<br>	In our design, users work with conventional content types (e.g. text, images, PDFs, and websites) within a radical new paradigm: a collaborative 3D knowledge graph.<br>	Through a workflow that combines elements of notetaking, mindmapping, and moodboarding, users build up spatial information workspaces that reflect the structure of their ideas.<br>	Users then compose and export linear syntheses of their knowledge graphs, in the form of markdown files, for use in downstream workflows.<br>	The immersive virtual workspace allows collaborators to step into the same information space for discussion and co-creation, regardless of physical distance.<br><br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><h3 id="F7EB2FA4-2C63-4931-8066-10794BF587CF">II. Design</h3><b><br></b><br><h4 id="B0C40DD2-DC6F-4758-86F4-0868B1CDC5E1">Items</h4><b><br></b><br>The entity primitive in Softspace is the <b><i>item</i></b>. Items are single pieces of content data, or containers that hold other items. Items correspond to what are called <i>blocks</i> in some other knowledge-management tools, such as Notion or Roam.<br><br><h4 id="35962F5E-36A5-4A87-81DD-836D82D87FB4">Content Items</h4><b><br></b><br>Conceptually, content items map best onto single files, although in cases such as text and URLs this correspondence does not strictly hold. Initially, content item types in Softspace include:<br><li>text paragraphs</li><br><li>static images</li><br><li>PDF documents</li><br><li>bookmarked websites</li><br>Future updates to Softspace may implement, among others:<br><li>tweets</li><br><li>videos</li><br><li>podcasts</li><br><br><h4 id="97E16602-30A7-4CF6-9726-BB1AC7550FF5">Container Items</h4><b><br></b><br>As their name suggests, container items hold other items. The initial design for Softspace only specifies a single type of container: the <b><i>topic</i></b>.<br>Topics can either be <i>expanded</i> or <i>collapsed</i>.<br><li>While expanded, the contents of a topic are displayed in a fixed <i>ordinospatial</i> layout that makes use of all three spatial dimensions while constraining contents to a single linear order. This ordinality makes topics mappable to conventional document formats (such as markdown), and usable as 3D notes.</li><br><li>While collapsed, the text contents of a topic become hidden. However, <i>backlinks</i> from hidden text to other topics are visible as connections between the collapsed topic and referent topics. Images, PDFs, websites, and other non-text contents remain visible—they float free of the collapsed topic, but remain visually and spatially connected to it.</li><br>Topics have a <i>title</i>: a string value that identifies that topic within the workspace. Future updates to Softspace will implement topic <i>aliases</i>: alternative titles (to accommodate capitalization, synonyms, orthographical variants, etc.) by which one topic is identified.<br>	When exporting a Softspace workspace, each topic is interpreted as a markdown file whose filename is the topic title, and whose contents are those of the topic.<br>	For performance and technical implementation reasons, the initial design of Softspace will only permit a single topic to be expanded at a time. Later updates will allow multiple topics to be expanded simultaneously.<br>	For performance and technical implementation reasons, the initial design of Softspace will not permit nested topics—i.e. topics cannot contain each other. Later updates will enable this.<br><br><h4 id="41D68A22-DA2C-44AF-A780-DEF4DFDE8902">Transclusion</h4><b><br></b><br><i>Transclusion</i> is a term coined by Ted Nelson in his 1980 publication <i>Literary Machines</i>. It refers to the concept of including a single piece of content across multiple contexts as live instances, so that a change in one instance is reflected across all instances.<br>	Softspace implements transclusion by allowing item types to be contained by any number of topics. Adding a transcludable item to a topic does not remove it from its other containers.<br>	Initially, this will be possible for item types which are highly atomic (semantically independent of their immediate context) and/or relatively immutable. Text items do not meet this criterion, and can therefore only be contained in a single topic at a time.<br>	Transclusion allows topic containers to function as tags.<br><br><h4 id="5FC26E80-783F-4BC3-9F09-F8762375B028">Backlinks</h4><b><br></b><br>The popularity of the note-taking app Roam Research (and Roam-like apps) can be largely attributed to its use of the <i>backlink</i> as a core interaction primitive. A backlink is an in-line reference from text to a conceptual entity. In the case of Roam, backlinks point to notes. In Softspace, backlinks point to topics.<br>	Our design borrows the [[]]-notation of Roam. Terms within a text item which are surrounded by double square brackets will be visually and spatially linked to the topic with the same title as the enclosed text. If no such topic exists, one will be created.<br>	When a topic is collapsed, the backlinks from its hidden text items remain visible as indicator lines that connect the collapsed topic to referent topics. In future updates, these indicators will display the snippet of text which contains the backlink.<br><br><h4 id="859D489E-622B-4B82-ADE3-315395E8C099">Spatiality</h4><b><br></b><br>Whiteboarding apps like Miro have proven the tangible value of being able to lay out information spatially in a software tool. Many apps which feature a canvas for UI design purposes, such as Figma, are often used as general-purpose boards instead. New tools built on this basic pattern seem to emerge daily, from Muse to Heptabase to Apple’s upcoming Freeform.<br>Spatial interfaces are effective because our brains have evolved to be astoundingly good at perceiving, remembering, and interpreting where objects are in our environment.<br>But a spatial canvas displayed on a laptop screen suffers from three drawbacks:<br>1.	2D supports less spatial complexity than 3D, limiting spatial semantics.<br>2.	The view cuts off at the edge of the screen, limiting contextual awareness.<br>3.	The user is not situated within the workspace, limiting spatial memory.<br><br>The design premise of Softspace is a 3D spatial canvas within which the user is situated; therefore, it bypasses the above three constraints.<br>	Further, our design incorporates three distinct modes for the spatial positioning of items in a workspace. These modes are optimized for different phases in the workflow.<br><br><h4 id="8CD45D15-439C-4127-9219-8972E58340FF">Ordinospatial Layout</h4><b><br></b><br>Within an expanded topic, items are laid out using a front-to-back, left-to-right, top-to-bottom system called an <i>ordinospatial</i> layout. All three spatial dimensions are used to arrange contents, but there is a definite order that makes each topic interpretable as a linear document.<br>	This mode is best for the content a user is working on directly at that moment. Using this layout is conceptually similar to drafting a 3D note.<br><br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><h4 id="5D2AB869-A268-4714-8653-096B49DA7E28">Force-Directed Layout</h4><b><br></b><br>Items whose positions are not fixed within an expanded topic are subject to the <i>force-directed</i> layout system. This is a simulation-based layout system that automatically gathers <i>related</i> items closer together in space, and pushes unrelated ones further apart.<br>Related items are those with a semantic relation in the knowledge graph. The initial design specifies two such relation types:<br><li><i>containment</i>: the relation between a topic and its included contents</li><br><li><i>reference</i>: the relation between a text item and topics it links to via [[]]-notation</li><br><br>This mode is best for content that is not currently being worked on. Items move themselves into a spatial configuration that makes visible the relationships between them.<br><br><h4 id="154E32FC-A63B-4827-897A-00F6AA78CA0A">Cartesian Layout</h4><b><br></b><br>Items not in an expanded topic can also be <i>pinned</i> in place, so that their position and rotation is no longer determined by the force-directed graph simulation. Instead, they remain at a fixed, user-determined Cartesian coordinate.<br>This mode is best for reference items that should be held in a specific spatial configuration.<br><br><h4 id="6871ECC6-287C-47F6-B827-E2D504980B55">Workspaces</h4><b><br></b><br>The highest-level organizational unit of Softspace is the <b><i>workspace</i></b>.<br>	Items are always created within a workspace. Initially, items will only have a single parent workspace; later updates may enable cross-workspace transclusion.<br>	Users can create, manage, open, close, and delete workspaces using an in-headset UI. The initial design for Softspace only permits a single workspace to be open at a time.<br>	Workspaces can either be <i>local</i> or <i>cloud</i>. Local workspace data is stored completely on-device, and are not multiuser-compatible. Cloud workspaces store their data to the cloud, and are multiuser-compatible. Softspace will launch with only local workspaces; cloud workspaces will be implemented shortly afterward.<br>	User permissions are managed at the workspace level. Permissions roles can include owner, administrator, and guest access.<br><br><h4 id="C4C2731C-EC3E-4DFE-BD36-0EF8F95C1747">Workflow Integration</h4><b><br></b><br>A key challenge when using mobile devices for productivity is the lack of a common file system. XR headsets are no exception. This deficit adds friction to the process of bringing files into and out of mobile software. If this friction is too high, it can feel like work gets “stuck” in the device, which understandably deters use.<br>Softspace is a designed to minimize this friction. It does this by:<br><li>Prioritizing support for content formats that are common across knowledge workflows, such as images, PDFs, and markdown files</li><br><li>Integrating with popular cloud file storage services like Dropbox, with automatic exports to maintain a readily-accessible copy of work outside the headset</li><br><li>	Implementing a full-featured in-app browser that makes the web easily accessible from within the headset</li><br>The goal is to maximize upstream and downstream compatibility with existing workflows, while retaining the unique advantages of this new computing medium. Users can quickly bring files into Softspace, work on them there, then easily access the contents of that workspace from their other devices at any time.<br><br><h4 id="E0E2C9B8-9B4C-461A-9393-BD86E2020782">Common File Formats</h4><b><br></b><br>Initially, users will be able to import:<br><li>Text files (.txt)</li><br><li>Markdown files (.md)</li><br><li>Image files (.jpg/.jpeg, .png, .tif/.tiff)</li><br><li>PDF files (.pdf)</li><br>Users will be able to export workspaces as a collection of 1) markdown files that correspond to its topics, and 2) image and PDF files.<br><br><h4 id="8F8CA6E2-128C-476B-9AA8-4BB89FCB16DF">Cloud Storage Integration</h4><b><br></b><br>Cloud file storage access is available in the form of a simple 2D web app that is accessible in-headset. It allows users to log into their cloud storage accounts, select files and folders for import, and select folders to export workspaces into.<br>	The first such integration will be with Dropbox, because of its large user base. We are also exploring Google Drive and local network drive access.<br><br><h4 id="7B579B5C-28E1-443D-8630-AB662192363F">In-App Web Browser</h4><b><br></b><br>A good web browser is central to almost all knowledge workflows. We implement a full-featured browser within Softspace that gives users access to the rest of the web, including the web app versions of complementary tools.<br>The in-app browser will allow the user to:<br><li>Browse websites, including web apps</li><br><li>Bookmark websites for future reference</li><br><li>Save images files from the web into workspaces</li><br><li>Snip any portion of the browser window into workspaces</li><br><li>Copy/paste text to and from text items</li><br><br><h4 id="C06F3B51-0726-4359-8F62-B71127A2F7E6">Multiuser Support</h4><b><br></b><br>Although by catalyzed the pandemic, we expect the importance of remote work to continue well into the future as companies seek top talent, and talent seeks geo-flexibility.<br>	However, video-based remote collaboration tools fall far short of the creative magic that is possible when working together in-person. XR closes the gap by creating a true sense of social co-presence between collaborators in the same virtual workspace.<br>	Softspace will not initially support multiple users, but its technical architecture has been designed from the beginning with multiuser collaboration in mind. We will enable this feature once cloud workspaces are implemented, as this is a key technical prerequisite.<br><br><h4 id="1CBF3A24-0A73-46EF-83F6-BB1ACADFB76E">Interaction Model</h4><b><br></b><br>Spatial computing remains in its infancy, and is evolving rapidly and divergently.<br>	The Softspace interaction model is designed to rely as little as possible on the specific features of today’s headsets, and to be highly portable across hardware and input paradigms.<br>	Therefore, our design only assumes a head-mounted 6DoF AR device (passthrough or see-through) with high-fidelity hand tracking and bluetooth keyboard support.<br><br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><h4 id="F381F84C-403A-4D10-B274-CAD30078EA08">Augmented Reality</h4><b><br></b><br>Full-occlusion virtual reality is unsuitable (at least as the default mode) for a tool intended for use in professional settings. Blindness to one’s immediate physical surroundings gives rise to a sense of unease and vulnerability. This prevents many users from entering the state of flow that is necessary for doing their best creative work.<br>	The design of Softspace is premised on an augmented reality paradigm that allows users to see their immediate environment. Virtual UI elements appear to float in this space. Initially, it will not be possible to anchor items to specific points in the physical environment, but this functionality will come with later updates.<br>	Happily, even the low-resolution passthrough augmented reality of the Quest headset is sufficient to dispel the discomfort that arises from visual occlusion.<br><br><h4 id="61952868-DB45-4483-BA2C-11694363E35E">Hand Tracking</h4><b><br></b><br>Currently, the most common input device for XR headsets is the hand controller. Optimized for gaming, this device is poorly suited to productivity use cases, because:<br><li>It must be held in the hand at all times, precluding the use of a keyboard</li><br><li>Its form, balance, and button placement are reminiscent of weaponry</li><br><li>It adds two more devices to keep charged, remember to pack, etc.</li><br>Therefore, all non-keyboard inputs in Softspace rely only on computer vision-based hand tracking, which has already been developed to a very high level of usability and reliability.<br><br><h4 id="0F3FA21C-F1F3-44D4-8AFC-7D55183CA8D0">Locomotion</h4><b><br></b><br>The way that virtual objects are overlaid on the view of the physical environment in Softspace makes user locomotion through the workspace technically equivalent to the spatial repositioning of the workspace around the user. The only difference between the two is frame of reference.<br>	Locomotion—or correspondingly, workspace repositioning—is initiated by forming a fist with one or both hands. This action “grabs” the workspace where the hand(s) is positioned. The user then moves the grabbing hand(s) to move, rotate, and scale the workspace.<br><br><h4 id="4DF574A1-E03B-4EE2-9C93-EEC9478B4986">Manipulation</h4><b><br></b><br>Our philosophy for the design of the Softspace UI can be characterized by <i>leveraged direct manipulation</i>. We want to give users a feeling of high agency, effectiveness, and control when interacting with objects in the workspace.<br>	Users highlight UI elements with a line-of-sight system, which uses an imaginary ray from the eye to the hand as its targeting vector.<br>	Once an item is highlighted, pinching the tip of the index finger to the thumb is interpreted as a <i>click</i> action, which either causes the highlighted object to be <i>used</i> or <i>grabbed</i>.<br>	Movements in the grabbing hand cause the grabbed item to be repositioned, with a leverage factor being applied to its motion along the user’s vector of view.<br>	Grabbing an item with two hands enables rescaling and resizing.<br><br><h4 id="7B83CA6E-B83F-488B-8053-E598E3744C3A">Text Input</h4><b><br></b><br>Given the centrality of natural language in knowledge work, text is a first-class content type in Softspace. Fast, accurate, frictionless text input is therefore absolutely critical.<br>	Given these requirements, there is simply no viable alternative to the use of a physical (bluetooth) keyboard as the primary text input device. However, a backup virtual keyboard is available at all times.<br>	Future releases of Softspace will explore additional text input methods, such as speech-to-text.<br><br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><h4 id="370D45AA-2066-4071-A720-2C94DDDC64B8">Art Design</h4><b><br></b><br>The designer of XR software has much more control over the sensory input of their user than the designer of a 2D app does. While in Softspace, everything a user sees (and much of what they hear) is the result of decisions we will have made. This gives us great power to shape the user experience, but also comes with greater responsibility to ensure it’s a good one.<br>	Two principles underpin the art design of Softspace: comfort and productivity.<br><br><i>Comfort</i><b><br></b>Comfort in Softspace has both an aesthetic and a performance component.<br>	Given the full-immersion nature of XR, less is more. Our aesthetic design is restrained and minimal. We rely on a limited palette of colors and a familiar set of geometries. We prefer to subtract, adding only when necessary.<br>	Performance-wise, maintaining a smooth 90fps on the Quest 2 (and 72fps on the Quest) is critical for user comfort. We therefore make creative use of a few simple meshes and shaders, to minimize compute load as the number of items in the workspace increases.<br><br><i>Productivity</i><b><br></b>Most XR software today is for gaming, entertainment, or other use cases where there is heightened value in sensory stimulation and excitement.<br>	In contrast, we are building software for deep work. To support this, we wish to promote focus, creativity, and flow instead.<br><br>Softspace UI elements, passthrough color filtering, animation behaviors and velocities, and other aspects of its look-and-feel are calibrated to foster these qualities.<br><br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><h3 id="E26EB040-BFF7-4201-B6AF-AA8E14C21963">III. User</h3><b><br></b><br>The intended user of Softspace is a high-agency knowledge worker whose livelihood depends on her ability to quickly and effectively synthesize complex sets of information. She might be:<br><li>An entrepreneur writing a product requirement doc</li><br><li>A design researcher summarizing user interviews</li><br><li>An independent analyst drafting a Substack post</li><br><li>An architect crafting a deck about a new project</li><br><li>A grad student outlining a chapter of her thesis</li><br>She currently uses a combination of analog tools (pen and paper, physical boards) and digital ones (Notion, Apple Notes) to collect information, make sense of it, and draft documents.<br>Crucially, she feels an acute frustration with the limitation of existing tools. She may be exploring spatial canvases (Muse, Figma) or structured note-taking apps (Roam, Notion) to help her manage and make use of her knowledge base.<br>These apps are steps in the right direction, but she wonders why there still isn’t software that gets close to the creative magic of a shared team project space.<br>Of course, to be able to download and use Softspace, she will need to have access to a compatible headset (e.g. a Quest 2).<br><br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><h3 id="BE68B52C-A12C-433D-B7AC-200AE15E68B5">IV. Flow</h3><br><b><br></b><h4 id="C7DAE33E-472D-4213-B248-48044F67B289">Workflow Phases</h4><b><br></b><br>Formally, the intended user flow of Softspace can be divided into three phases:<br>1.	<b>Collection</b>: adding relevant information to a workspace via cloud storage and the web<br>2.	<b>Construction</b>: building up the knowledge graph by writing notes and composing topics<br>3.	<b>Collation</b>: composing synthesis topics intended for export as linear outlines or drafts<br>In practice, we expected users to cycle through this flow many times, jumping between steps as they seek to make sense of a knowledge problem and explore different solutions to it.<br><br><h4 id="FFC657C0-F4EA-4549-B0EA-721BFB7217D0">Example Flow</h4><b><br></b><br>For example, this is how somebody might use Softspace to draft a design proposal:<br><br>1.	Collect images and PDFs related to the project into a Dropbox folder. Export notes from a note-taking app as markdown files into the Dropbox folder. This content likely includes:<br>		project brief<br>		reference images<br>		client interview notes<br>		previous project materials<br>2.	Launch Softspace on headset, and create a new workspace.<br>3.	Using the cloud storage UI, import the contents of the Dropbox folder to the workspace.<br>		Text and markdown files are converted into Softspace topic items<br>		Images and PDFs are converted to the corresponding content items<br>4.	Build up a project knowledge map from these contents by:<br>		Creating and writing text blocks<br>		Creating topic and adding content to them<br>		Referencing various topics from within text<br>		Adding images using the in-app web browser<br>		Copy/pasting text using the in-app web browser<br>		Bookmarking URLs using the in-app web browser<br>5.	Create a new synthesis topic which is intended for export. Compose a draft of the design proposal through a combination of 1) including content items already in the workspace and 2) writing new text that ties ideas and content together.<br>6.	Using the cloud storage UI, select a Dropbox folder to export the workspace to. (This can be a one-off action, or be set to recur automatically.)<br>7.	Copy the synthesis topic’s markdown file into a word processor for editing and formatting.<br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><center><h2 id="5591787F-E215-45C5-8756-3FC2D73FACF9">Journal Guest Presentation : Discussing Softspace</h2><br></center><br><a href="https://youtu.be/SjQrimm4mGU">https://youtu.be/SjQrimm4mGU</a> <br><br><b>Yiliu Shen-Burke:&nbsp;My own journey into the specific question of VR and text is actually a little bit circuitous, it's not where I started out. </b>In fact, only very recently in my process of prototyping and building what is ultimately intended to be a commercial product, an app that people will download and use, and be financially self-sustaining. The role of text has only recently become a very central one, and probably, honestly, the reason for that was because I was a little bit scared of this question, of working with text in VR. Because I think all of us, who use computers on a regular basis, we know how central text is, and it seems to be the point at which all of the shortcomings of the hardware, up until very recently, came to the most obvious head, where it seemed like the screen resolution, more than the screen resolution, the fact that text is just presented in it on a 2D plane. And it didn't seem to be a need to work with it in a three-dimensional way, or at least at first glance. I think all of these factors contribute to my reticence in tackling text. I recently I started doing it, and it's been absolutely, incredibly mind-opening, and I think there are, to refer to earlier about the combination of spatial interfaces within text being one of the most transformative technological opportunities that are coming our way, I totally agree with. And what Brandel was saying about this combination actually being an existing way back in the earliest histories of computing. And also with Ivan Sutherland’s AR Experiments. Actually, people have been wanting to do this for decades, and only very recently because of these billion-dollar tech giants and their investments, it has become technically usable for people like me just to throw things together, and actually, have it work and be usable.&nbsp;<br>	<b>Five years ago I was a VR research resident at an artist's studio here in Berlin.</b> I was on leave from architecture school. There's an artist here in Berlin called Olafur Eliasson who has a very big operation, over 100 programmers, designers, craftspeople, PR people, social media people, and among them myself, the VR research resident. And the reason why I got this job was because the DK2 had just come out, someone in the studio had bought two of them, and they realized that there was nothing to run on these apps. They couldn't just download something and run on it, was the very early days. So I convinced someone that I knew enough programming to do something interesting with these headsets. I didn't. But I was able to, very luckily, throw together enough of something every two weeks or so to show the rest of the studio that I was able to teach myself more and more of these, sort of, technical skills required. But coming from architecture, I was very comfortable with remodeling in Unity and things like this. And what happened over the course of that one year was that, we were building these prototypes to explore the potential of virtual reality as either a medium for actual artworks, or as a tool for the production process of other works which may not end up being digital at all, but as a working environment. Both very, sort of, fruitful&nbsp;and still very fruitful avenues for the application of the technology. At the time I was using Evernote, because that was kind of like the best digital notebook that was around, or the only one I knew about, and very quickly, it became super annoying to use Evernote to manage those processing cycles. So I was trying to build something every two weeks, collecting ideas by talking to people in the studio, throwing together a working program, and then, showing to them at the end of the cycle. And to manage all the ideas that were coming in, and all the ideas were coming going out, I was using Evernote, and it was a huge pain to make sense of all the ideas that I’ve been collecting, and there's stuff in there that you'll never find again. It's a classic issue with 2D UIs. And at the same time, I was in this artist studio that is just covered from floor to ceiling, wall-to-wall, taking up this entire old beer brewery in Berlin, with the physical artifacts of the design processes, and creative processes of the other teams around. And so I started thinking, and this isn't just me, there were also snippets of this idea during the demos and during my conversations with artists themselves, about <b>why we couldn't use this inherently spatial medium to actually start recreating some of the advantages of a physical workspace with physical artifacts, and pieces of information around. </b>And this really started getting me thinking, and thinking, and I started prototyping some things, pulling information from their in-house CMS that used to power the website with archival images and things from previous exhibitions and works. And it quickly became clear that, "Okay, an artist studio is not the right, kind of, environment to start trying to build a brand new general-purpose tool." And I was coming from architecture school, I knew I didn't actually want to become an artist or an architect for that matter. And so I decided, "Okay, this is probably a tech start-up. I don't know if that is, but that sounds a thing, and people give me money to do it." <br><b>	So in 2018, we founded a company,</b> got a little bit of investment from an accelerator in Silicon Valley, and started trying to build a spatial virtual studio for designers called Softspace, and that's still the name of the company and the product. And at the time, the overriding, I guess, was quite skeuomorphic. A paradigm that I had was that you would have this very large like, your dream studio workspace, where the laws of physics, and the constraints of physical&nbsp;materials didn't apply, but you would still have a lot of the behaviours and affordances of the physical media that, especially, visual artists or designers are used to working with.<br>	I’m going to just quickly jump into my headset now, Frode, and show you the version of the software that we built and released on SideQuest, which is an indie app store and it's where we first tested our vision for what the future of creative knowledge work might be. <b>SoftSpace is what we called it</b>, just for shorthand SoftSpace version 2020, because it was first released in July 2020, almost exactly two years ago. And this is what it looks like. I know the field of view here is not going to be massive, so I’m trying to keep my hands in the middle of my field of view. But you can see here that what you have is, very literally, a massive white wall room.&nbsp;So what I’m doing now is, I’m actually sharing the screen instead of the feed now, so that should work. It forces Zoom to just show this through-the-lens view to everybody. The only downside to this mode is that the frame rate is going to be quite low, so I’m just going to move very slowly, and that way, you should see what I am doing. Does that sound good? Okay. So I’ll just (indistinct) again which is that SoftSpace version 2020 is:<br><li>In many ways, a recreation of the big, empty, white room that you can pin stuff up in wherever you like that came out of the experiences I have working at this artist's studio. That's a very simplistic way of describing the paradigm here. </li><br><li>A slightly secondary, or second-order understanding or explanation for why this app works the way it does is that, I didn't have any idea of what the right layout paradigms, or what the right revealing structural relations between pieces of information in a three-dimensional user interface should be, at all. </li><br>This version of the app was never intended for a broader distribution on an official app store or anything. It's what we were calling internally, a cartesian sandbox. You can grab any item, and I just wanted to do something over here to find my text, so I’m going to grab this little text note here, so I can make it big, I can make it small, I can move it freely in a three-dimensional space, and I can rotate it within a&nbsp;certain, like, it snaps in terms of its rotation, but I can, kind of, put it wherever I want. And within this cartesian playground, in a sense, you have all of the freedom and power of spatiality to express relations between things, by positioning them and scaling them relative to each other. So if any of you are familiar with the whiteboarding app, Miro, this is essentially a 3D version of Miro. And you can see that there are objects which are containers, and these containers can hold other things. There are objects which are boards, which are 2D containers, you can pop items off and put them onto the boards. And there even is, for example, a fully functional built-in web browser that you can agree to get cookies installed onto, and you can Google for topics that might be of interest during your research process. And if you find an image of something you like, you can pop it out and save it to your workspace, like so.<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>So one of the things we have discussed, and that I have a great fear of, is<b> ghettoizing or sandboxing,</b> or whatever it might be. And currently, there are, of course, many applications where you can view your laptop screen in VR, and they're all quite neat. But the problem is that, that is just a texture, it's just isolated. So can you, please, elaborate on how you took something from that screen into the room? Because, I think, that is really wonderful and important.<br><b>Stephanie Strickland:&nbsp;</b>Can I ask a question too? Which is, can you get the text off a 2D surface and set the letters free in the 3d space?<br><b>Yiliu Shen-Burke:&nbsp;</b>Not yet, but I will get there. So that's a really great question. <br>	And Frode, the context of the question you asked about sandboxing is exactly what prompted me at the end of the 12 months of having this version of the app out in the wild, hearing feedback from that, watching people using it, deciding, "No. This is not the direction." And kickstarting my latest cycle of prototyping. <br>	But just to really speak, specifically about the technical, I guess, implementation of this popping things off, <b>this is a fully functional Firefox web browser running inside the SoftSpace app. </b>And I’m using a package called Viewplex, and this is all running in Unity C#. But what Viewplex lets me do is pass messages between the HTML-JavaScript environment inside the browser. And &nbsp;the C# environment outside of the browser in this app itself. And so, whenever my cursor touches something that is marked as an image, the browser tells the VR app, and the VR app then knows, "Ah, okay. Your cursor is actually hovering over something that can be downloaded out as an image." And so, you see this icon, it changes from this manipulation icon to this copy-out icon. And if I press the trigger then, actually, it's going to the URL, the original URL of this image, and downloading the full resolution version of this image, and then saving it to the cloud storage backend that we're using for this particular version of the app.<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Can you also copy and paste that way?<br><b>Yiliu Shen-Burke:&nbsp;You can also copy and paste, and the way you do that is, there's a separate tool called Snip. </b>For example, if this whole thing, this website were not actually accessible as an image, sometimes website makers decide to hide everything under an element that blocks your ability to directly select things, I can press the trigger on this controller, switch to a snipping tool, which will just make a copy of this entire, any part of the web texture that I wish to make a copy of. So that's just a straight, one-to-one texture copy of what the browser was seeing. And that same tool, actually, just with a click, lets me make a copy.<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Can you have more than one person in this room, currently?<br><b>Yiliu Shen-Burke:&nbsp;</b>Yes. <b>This is fully multi-user enabled.</b> Okay, as I was saying earlier, this was released on SideQuest, in the app store, which is a side-loading early access marketplace for apps. We have gotten 3.000 registered users, and 6,000 downloads of the app, and even a handful of paying users of the premium plan. But when I was thinking about, “Okay, how would we, then, take this and bring it to market, to the official app store for the Quest headset?” Which is a much larger user base, I realized that, I was, at a fundamental level, immensely dissatisfied with the paradigm that this app represents. And in fact, <b>this paradigm was never intended to be the final paradigm. </b>This was very much research, an applied research vehicle, to understand what people wanted to do if they were given the ability to place 2D content, largely because, we're talking about images and text blocks, what they would want to do with 2D content in a 3D space that they could freely place things in, and move themselves around? And this is what prompted, then, me to kickstart the cycle of rapid prototyping, and then, releasing those prototypes to the public, on Twitter, mostly. I started in February of this year, which has been incredibly rewarding and fruitful, and I’m just going to show you a couple of those experiments which will then lead you all the way up to the final point of where I am today, questions I have for you as a group of people who have been thinking about these problems for a lot longer than I have, or much more deeply than I have.<br>	 And also, I believe it was Stephanie, who asked the question about being able to pull text off.&nbsp; I’ll get to that at the very end of it. I don't want to forget about you, I’ll show you what I mean.<br><b>Stephanie Strickland:&nbsp;</b>And also <b>changing the font at any point and so on.</b><br><b>Yiliu Shen-Burke:&nbsp;</b>I<b>&nbsp;</b>see. Okay. Yeah. So specific text formatting tools, I actually have not spent a lot of time building out, but I will show you what I have been looking at. So this is, in a literal nutshell, if you scale (indistinct). This is SoftSpace version 2020. And a very instructive research environment for figuring out what the actual paradigm for SoftSpace that would actually tap into the full power of this CDM should be.<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Do you need a PC to run this or can it be run independently in just a headset?<br><b>Yiliu Shen-Burke:&nbsp;</b>This is all standalone. Although we do have a PC version, this is running completely on the Quest. I’m actually going to go backwards a little bit from the prototypes that I’ve been building starting from&nbsp;February, and I’m going to start with prototype number 3, which is the latest one that I’ve published, and which I was very happy with for getting a bunch of attention on Twitter. <br> 	<b>Prototype 03, there are a couple of things you will notice right off the bat. The first thing is that, this is an augmented reality, or mixed reality enabled application. </b>So there's no longer this completely immersive virtual environment that you're thrown into, which blocks out your view of your physical surroundings. And I had come to the realization that, even me personally, someone who's worked in VR for many years now, and should be very comfortable with this medium, every time I went into VR and covered up my eyes, I had this really inevitable low-level sense of unease and vulnerability that came from not being able to see my surroundings. And so, when Oculus, back when it was still Oculus, released the pass-through SDK and made it possible for app developers to access pass-through video, I was sceptical at first, I tried it, and I just thought,<b> “This is the future. SoftSpace will always be an augmented reality or a mixed reality app from now on.”</b> And then the second thing is that, I just put my controllers down because everything is <b>now being controlled by my hands only. </b>So this is just the standard Oculus hand tracking. It's gotten very good. It's gotten a lot better than it was when I first started playing with it. And the combination of these two features, the pass-through video, and hand tracking, also were the enabling factors for me to really start thinking seriously about text input because it means that you can have<b> a physical Bluetooth keyboard</b> that you can easily start typing on, without putting your controllers down first and that you can see because it's pass-through enabled.<br>	So this is the context of the prototyping cycle that I currently embarked on. And <b>the specific question that Prototype 03 was trying to answer was, how could you map an ordinal set of information onto a three-dimensional space? </b>And I’m sure you all know what those words mean, but specifically what I mean is, in the previous version of SoftSpace, and as Frode was saying, there is this issue that information that is arranged in a three-dimensional cartesian layout, 2D has this issue as well, but 3D makes it interesting for me, more impossible, is forever stuck inside a 3D environment. <br>	Because there is no reliable, dependable, sensible way to take a collection of information that is arbitrarily placed in a 3D space and, for example, export it to something you could email and have someone else read it on their phone on the train. And if that's going to be the case, then, I mean, I found this from our users, and from myself as well,<b> you're just not going to be willing to invest time and energy into working on something if it's only going to be stuck inside the headset. </b><br>	<b>And by the way, 95% of the time, you yourself, in the future, will not have access to a headset. </b>So if the work you do, you can't even access it yourself reliably, you're just not going to want to put any time into it. And so, Prototype 03 was trying to figure out, <b>“Okay. Could or in what world would it make any sense, for the underlying data structure that your 3D workspace is represented, to actually be an ordinal data format?”</b> For example, I’m just using an example here. Markdown. So if everyone's familiar with Markdown, a wonderful standard for interchange between different applications.<b> </b><br>	<b>Could a VR, AR app actually be working with Markdown?</b> And what would that even mean? And so that's the one question. <br>	<b>And the dumbest possible way, of course, to answer it would be, and this is something that you do see out, around in different applications, would be just to put a 2D window inside a VR that has a 2D-UI,</b> and shows you a Markdown file. It shows your website or whatever. Shows you ordinal content the same way you see it on your laptop. But, of course, if you take that approach, you're giving up all of the richness of the expressiveness of spatial semantics. <b>You're giving up the whole point of putting the headset on. And I didn't want to go to that. </b><br>	I’m sure other people are working on the virtual desktops because they're going to be amazing, but that's not just where I felt like I can make the biggest contribution. So how would you represent the Markdown file in 3D without resorting to importing a 2D paradigm? <br><br><b>Markdown in Ordinospatial Layout</b><br>	The answer I came up with, and I’m going to call here the <b>Ordinospatial Layout, </b>is one where you do have a set of very strict rules for determining the order of things. But you're using all three spatial dimensions to express that order. <br>	So to make it clear what I’m talking about. This block of text, this text block, is its own object, and it can live at a specific point place in this column. And so, if you were to take this, and you were to export it as a Markdown file, which, by the way, the headset is doing, this entire workspace is, right now, saved out as a Markdown. Every time you write something here, it's saved out as Markdown. This could be the first paragraph, this could be the second, this could be the third, etc. You can also move it over here, and maybe, I just want to place another block of text below this. And I can start typing on it. I can say, “Hello.” I really can't touch type, by the way. “Hello, everybody.” <br>	And so, you can see that I can move this along this plane. I can start constructing columns of text. <br>	And I can move things relatively freely, if I want to move this thing way only over here, I don't want to think about it, for now, I can do so. 	But it has a definite point and definite order within the global set of content: <b>There's no place I can put it that doesn't have a meaning.</b><br>	And to extend this to the third dimension, I can always move these blocks of text between these series of planes that are, actually, not visually represented at all. That's one of the shortcomings of this prototype. They're invisible and you, kind of, have to just know that, "Okay, there will be a plane there if I pull this thing far enough." So this is prototype number three, and this got a lot of attention on the internet, and people started asking, "Could you do this? Could you do that? Could you start breaking free of this very strict ordinal layout?" And it was great because I suddenly started having really rigorous and in-depth conversations with people who had thought very seriously about this kind of question. How do you represent ordinal content in a three-dimensional way without losing the benefits of one or the other, including being introduced to this group here? And what I just want to show you now, again, I’m jumping through between the prototypes. Stephanie, you asked about the possibility of pulling something off. And so, in this particular prototype, you can move things around, but the objects are always, or the text blocks are always going to have a place within the underlying, essentially, Markdown file. There's no way that I can pull this over here and say, "This is going to be in a completely different area altogether. I don't want to think about it." It's going to end up in the Markdown file, <b>this entire space is just one 3D Markdown file.</b> And, of course, this cannot be where this experiment ends. And so I want to show you prototype number four, a work in progress because is what I’m currently working on.<br><br><b>Prototype 04</b><br><b>Yiliu Shen-Burke:&nbsp;</b>Okay. Well, I hope you have some capacity left for both enjoying this demo, and also, questions, critiques, thoughts, avenues of research, and exploration. Because this is exactly the phase I’m in right now. So, okay. Prototype 04 says, "Well, yes, it's great that I can take these blocks of text, and I can work with them in 3D, and have this beautiful board of stuff in front of me that I know will be exportable easily as an email, or exportable as presentation, or I can finish writing here, or I can draft up something here and finish writing it on my phone, on the train ride home." But aren't we over-constraining things a little bit? What if you want something that is not actually in this document, let's think of this board as a document, but it's related to it and lives nearby, or maybe lives in another document over here because it's a 3D canvas, so we can do all these things that we can't easily do in a 2D-UI. Well, maybe you could just take something, like this text block, and pop it off and just have it start floating nearby. And you could run a little 3D force directive graph stimulation, so that everything is spaced out very comfortably. Is everyone here familiar with Roam Research, by the way? Okay. So using something like Roam Research, it's double square bracket notation for indicating references to other topics. Maybe as I’m typing here, I could start adding references on this topic or that topic, and those references, actually, become newly created free-floating objects, which then start, through the force-directed graph simulation, start pulling the blocks of text, which are related to that block you're working on, closer to where you are working. And pushing the things that are not so related further out, so you start getting a three-dimensional representation of these semantic relations of all the elements inside a project you're working on. And so you can see here, I just pulled a couple of little blocks of things off, they're floating around, they try to flee from each other, so.<br><br><b>Stephanie Strickland:&nbsp;</b>I do have a question here. <b>Who decides what's related to what here?&nbsp;</b><br><b>Yiliu Shen-Burke:</b>&nbsp;You do it manually.<br><b>Stephanie Strickland:</b>&nbsp;You said that things started aggregating on the basis of their relation.<br><b>Yiliu Shen-Burke:&nbsp;</b>Yes,&nbsp;and so, what I was mentioning earlier was, in Roam, what you can do... And this is my current work-in-progress prototype, so it's not implemented here. But, in Roam, you could create a tag, or create a new topic, actually, in Roam it's a new note. You can create a new note, but using this notation of a double square bracket, and say, for example, Frode, right? And this would create, automatically, for example, a Frode object over here. And then, in other parts of the document, where I have mentioned Frode, or I’ve written exactly this string of text, [[Frode]], the Frode object would start floating, and the thing is, there would have to be some visual indication of the relation. So there would there be some line that would draw from...<br><b>Stephanie Strickland:</b>&nbsp;Okay, so my question is; that means that ahead of time you had to tag things. So what I’m interested in is, what kind of space, whereas I glance over it, and now the connections are occurring to me that have not occurred before, am I able to create some kind of skeleton, or structure, or whatever kind of structure I use, a tree or otherwise, that I can, on the fly, create this thing? I don't want to have to have this (indistinct) ahead of time. If I decide ahead of time, I already know all I need to know about the text in it.<br><b>Yiliu Shen-Burke:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, I see what you mean. I would, actually, say that the secret to Roam Research, and its success, was its insight. Even if you are manually adding in these references as you're writing up your notes, it doesn't mean that you are able to hold in your mind a global picture of where else an entire set of notes you've ever mentioned in this one topic. And so you're always working locally and you're saying, "Okay, today I’m going to write up some reading notes about this book that Frode presented." For example. And I’m reading some reading notes I’m going to create some square brackets to annotate topics. And then, you switch to a different view in Roam, and you see all the other places where that topic has been backlinked, and you have a global picture. And so, I would say that, actually, it's not that you have to tag things ahead of time, it's that, as you are working, you're just pulling out these instances of references, and then you take a step back, and you look around, and you see...<br><b>Stephanie Strickland:&nbsp;</b>Okay, wait a second. All relations are not references. Okay. So you have a very citation-based idea. I mean, obviously, a huge database and you can aggregate different parts of it as you query it different ways, right? But the point is, how do you create different structures of relation on the basis of interacting with lots of texts. Do you see what I’m saying it's (indistinct)?<br><b>Yiliu Shen-Burke:&nbsp;</b>I see what you're saying. I actually, so, I don't know if you are familiar with Jack Rusher he's based here in Berlin, and he worked on semantic web, and he and I had this exact same conversation. <b>And you're absolutely correct. Not all relations between two things are a reference, or even, I mean, yes, it is a reference, but it's much more nuanced than that. It's a kind of reference, it is supporting evidence, it is refuting evidence, it is that qualifying information, it is an instance of that.</b><br><b>Stephanie Strickland:&nbsp;It's architectural.</b> I refer you back to your architectural training. I mean, I might have a whole set of terms from architecture, or from music, in terms of which I could create a structure which is not based on citational reference.<br><b>Yiliu Shen-Burke:&nbsp;</b>Correct. And so, in that case, you might be talking about containment relations, where there is a taxonomy that you're trying to build up. And that is also absolutely possible in this work-in-progress that I’m building, or the future version of it. I haven't built it out yet. I’ll show you in the next demo something that you know what it could look like. But just to, maybe, hint at where the possibility for doing that kind of relation-building comes from, I would just like to note that, this document itself can be seen as, for example, an instance of this Frode-type topic, in which I have placed a bunch of Frode-related blocks. So I could also create many of these containers in a nested fashion and start building up these taxonomies of meaning, and of information that's something you're talking about. I’m just going to go to the final demo, which will maybe hint at where this is all going. Boom.<br><b>Stephanie Strickland:&nbsp;</b>So, I think it would be nice if everybody could build their own kind of memory palace out of the material. Do you know what I mean by memory palace?<br><b>Yiliu Shen-Burke:&nbsp;</b>I do. And I would say that, even the paradigm I’ve just shown you would make that totally possible. So this is actually Prototype01, and I just want to show you, and the order is intentional here. So Prototype 01 is very different from what I’ve shown you before. This is actually an interface for navigating my personal Dropbox and here's there's one folder called SoftSpace Research. I’m going to select this Dropbox folder to be spatialized and you'll see what it's doing. So, this is why, I’m sorry, Stephanie, that I cut you off a little bit, I wanted to move on to this demo to show you what some of the possibilities start to be, right? So this is very simple. We're looking at folders and folders with images. And I’m just using that very simple directed-tree containment structure to build a three-dimensional force director graph, it's pulling in previews...<br><b>Stephanie Strickland:&nbsp;</b>Can you put your hand into there to twist that structure?<br><b>Yiliu Shen-Burke:&nbsp;</b>Yes. So I could, for example, say, "Oh, this branch needs to go over here." It's going to take a second because there's a lot of stuff to pull, but...&nbsp;<br><b>Stephanie Strickland:&nbsp;</b>Can you, then, put it all on the surface of a dome?&nbsp;<br><b>Yiliu Shen-Burke:&nbsp;</b>No, but by combining this and the previous demo I just showed, you would be able to, for example, indicate, "Okay. I want to see this topic, but laid out ordinally." Once I get to start working on it, I want to be able to write notes and place things in a specific order, that makes sense to read from beginning to end. And this is the point I found earlier, while the rest of the content, which is not contained in that ordinal layout, can still float nearby and can adapt to the positioning of the things in the ordinal layout? So you can look around and say, "Okay. Actually, this other topic is also related, let me make sure I mention that, or pull something from there." Prototype01 doesn't have any text. I kind of worked backwards here because Prototype01 was very much about three-dimensional force-directed graph, hand tracking, pass-through video. Text was too scary for me, even at that point, and it took me a while to like, build up the courage, almost, to really tackle it, because what if it turned out that there was just no good way to work with text in VR? That's a major dead end to run into, but happily, I think, prototype two, three, four, proves that, actually, is very pleasant to write in VR. You have no distractions. You can place the text you're working on right in front of you. It's actually really nice. The only issue being, right now, the ergonomics of the headset need to be improved. I’m going to leave this running, just over here, and put my headset down with a nice close-up view of it. Questions? Prototype4 is a work-in-progress. There are a lot of things I want to like... I haven't finished building yet, but I’m very open to ideas, like the ones that Stephanie has been offering about how to connect all these technical and whiz-bang UI demos, back to real things that real people do to get real things done.<br><br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, that's important. I have to have an initial question, actually. And that is, on the issue of collapsing, and especially in expanding. Especially in your previous view, there was a lot of stuff which is amazing.<b> What mechanism do you have for, "Okay. I’m dealing with this. I want that stuff out of the way right now."?<br>Yiliu Shen-Burke:&nbsp;</b>Yeah. None, on these prototypes. I was literally thinking about this earlier today. Because you do get to a point, pretty quickly, when you have a few hundred items. And by the way, text level of detailing, LOD, is another very interesting issue that arises in the 3D environment. Because you can't read text that's just far away enough that the letters are too small. But collapsing things, I don't fully know the answer yet, but <b>probably it will be via the topic containers. </b>So probably you will do your querying in a sense, or highlighting the content items by saying which topics I want to keep visible, and which topics I don't need to be distracted by at this point. And maybe, by turning on or off certain topic containers, the nodes themselves, any content item that is not directly, or maybe two degrees of separation, related to those topics, would, probably, not disappear altogether. You probably want some visual indication, "Oh, there's something over there." But it could be a small icon representation, instead of the full content itself. But I don't know the answer to that, because I think the best approach will make itself known through people actually trying to use this thing, and then realizing, "All right. I need to hide certain kinds of things away." And what is the logic, even, to decide which things to hide, and which things to keep in the workspace?<br><b><br>Passthrough/background</b><br><br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Okay. And then, a tiny question before I’m sure there's going to be billions from everyone. In your AR use here with a <b>pass-through,</b> the background on my screen, at least, is monochromatic, slightly warm. Is this something that I will have the ability to decide how it's rendered?&nbsp;<br><b>Yiliu Shen-Burke:&nbsp;</b>So the fact that it's monochromatic is the hardware limitation of this headset. Very happily you can see in all the promotional videos that MedVa has been releasing about their upcoming hardware, and also on the various leaks on YouTube that Meta and also, rumour has it, Apple, all these billion dollar projects are leaning very heavily into full colour, high resolution, low latency pass-through, so.&nbsp;<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>I’m kind of leaning in the other direction because the normal pass through it's kind of harsh. So did you tilt it a little bit to reduce the contrast?<br><b>Yiliu Shen-Burke:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, I did.<b> I dramatically reduced the luminance levels, and also reduced contrast a little bit. Because it is impossible to focus on free-floating digital content when you also see your full colour room around you.</b> So when that pastel gets much better, I’m sure I will still have to tone it down to make it usable.&nbsp;<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Do you have an interaction feeling for how that should be done? Because I could imagine, with the next generation hardware, you'd want to be in really great resolution to see the room, and then, you want to tone it down. Have you thought about how (indistinct)?<br><b>Yiliu Shen-Burke:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, I have. So the short answer is, yes, because to make a lot of the promotional videos for this these prototypes, I’ve actually used a dummy 3D environment in Unity and so it's not this grainy video of my kitchen, it's actually this fake pleasingly rendered mountain cottage. So there it's, of course, by default, full colour. And I had to play with the settings a little bit to figure out what you have to do to the pass-through video to make it not distracting. And it seems that just by reducing the luminance, the exposure value quite a bit, maybe cutting it by half or by two-thirds, it's enough that your brain can distinguish background to the foreground. I mean, that's the main issue, that you need to quickly, automatically distinguish foreground virtual content from background irrelevant information.<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And in 2D we have drop shadows, outlines, and all that kind of stuff. But what I’m wondering is, have you thought of the interaction? Does the user do this thing? Twist their hand? Move their head? wWhat might be natural? Because what we're seeing here is something that we're going to be doing 100 times a day in the near future, I think.<br><b>Yiliu Shen-Burke:&nbsp;</b>Are you asking about how to turn on the filtering for the pass-through? Or maybe I’m not fully understanding the question.<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>I’m saying, I’m in a room, looking as high-res and beautiful as I can, and I’m working on something which is really special, and I want to dim the light, so to speak. Have you thought of human-computer interaction for that?<br><b>Yiliu Shen-Burke:&nbsp;</b>No, I haven't. Because the paradigm, right now, is that, you would open up this particular app to be able to work with this content, and therefore, there's no provision in my app for running without the background filter on, because there always is going to be SoftSpace virtual content. But if I think, at an OS level, then there would need to be something. Yeah. I don't know. I actually haven't played with ways to control that reality modulation using user-controlled gestures or inputs.<br><b>Peter Wasilko:&nbsp;</b>Yes. Would it be possible to generate a fog effect? So it would be like the room but in a heavy ground fog?<br><b>Yiliu Shen-Burke:&nbsp;</b>I<b>&nbsp;</b>guess you could. So the upcoming hardware is supposed to have better depth detection, which is something you would need in order to map a Z value to the different parts of the path through video. So because with this headset, it doesn't know which parts of this image are further away, and therefore, should be foggier, and which parts are closer. But that's actually a great idea, because what you really want is, you want to be able to see, well, I mean, so you may notice that like this object, this virtual object, can actually float behind this table, for example. And that's, by design, intentional. I just think it's going to be too constrained to design a design interface that's really reliant on physical features in your room. What if you're in a hotel room and you don't have enough space to work on your PhD dissertation, which is massive? I think that would be really problematic. So part of toning down the background is also to make it easier for your brain to accept that this virtual object can be floating behind the desk. And it's okay. It actually looks strange at first. It doesn't cause any physical discomfort or anything, which it would if the background were full exposure.<br><b>Stephanie Strickland:&nbsp;</b>A new thing just occurred to me, it seems like you should be able to just select out that floating tree of things and have the background completely disappear. I mean, because I’m just looking at the selected thing, so that would tone it down. But my real question was, <b>at what point can we expect hardware that isn't any more difficult to wear than a pair of glasses? Or if, almost, a pair of goggles?<br>Yiliu Shen-Burke:&nbsp;</b>I<b>&nbsp;</b>think a while. What I do know is that, from all these YouTube leaks that happened, things are coming quite soon, in the order of, definitely not years, so sooner than that from all the major players. New hardware is coming that has a much greater emphasis on ergonomics, comfort, the balance of weight on your head, and pass-through that will actually make it feel less socially awkward to be wearing a headset and to have your eyes covered in a professional setting or in a social setting. It's going to be incremental. I don't have any insider knowledge on this, but from what I’ve seen in the press, see-through augmented reality display technology is incredibly difficult, to the point of maybe physically impossible. So that's going to take a long time and I don't know that that's necessarily the end game. It might just be that we end up with really high quality pass-through displays, because you can also do a lot more with pass-through displays because you have full control of the colour of every pixel. So you can have occlusion, you can have filtering, and you can have stuff that is really difficult in smart classes.<br><b>Stephanie Strickland:&nbsp;</b>But pass-through, that does not allow me to&nbsp;change my location, my visual location, at will, between this room I’m in right now, which you don't see, and the VR location.<br><b>Yiliu Shen-Burke:&nbsp;</b>Well, it could. Because you could have selective filtering. I haven't seen any great interface design examples of this, but you could have a virtual room that had windows through, which you had the pass-through coming through. So you could peek out the window to see what's going on in your physical kitchen that you're sitting in.<br><b>Stephanie Strickland:&nbsp;</b>No I don't want to peek out. I want to look out and see where three small children have disappeared around the whole space. I want to actually see the space, and then I want to see this space. I want a choice of spaces. That's what I want to be able to have.&nbsp;<br><b>Yiliu Shen-Burke:</b>&nbsp;I mean, my mind is going to all sorts of things. 3D scanners set up in your house that you could then see a recreated theme all over your house. But, I mean, at least a pass-through would be much closer to offering that possibility than to the see-through headset. So, yeah.<br><b>Brandel Zachernuk:&nbsp;</b>But, Stephanie. One of the things that I’ve played with in the past is having passed-through portals, where you place objects in your virtual reality environment that are stand-ins for where you always want to be able to see specific things, so you can have a doorway. I placed a specific persistent pass-through portal over my keyboard, such that I have the ability to be able to see that. So once you have an overarching capacity to alternate those things, there are all sorts of different ways of attenuating the virtual view, so that you have the ability to see the different pieces of it.<br><b>Stephanie Strickland:&nbsp;</b>That would be great, the attenuation. In other words, you could dial it down, right? If I just had an analogue dial that would remove the virtual view completely from my view, so that I now had my default, realistic view. But then I could just turn it up again so that I could, you know, now I’m back seeing the VR view.<br><b>Yiliu Shen-Burke:&nbsp;</b>I'll give you a functional example of this. If you step outside the safety boundaries, the Oculus headset will just show you pass-through. So I’m trying to show that I’m just moving the headset outside the safety boundary, and you can see the virtual object coming in and out.<br><b>Stephanie Strickland:&nbsp;</b>You have to take that off your head to do that, right?<br><b>Brandel Zachernuk:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, it's simply a function of where you're standing. Because in the parlance of the system there's a safety boundary in which you've designated. You promise nothing's going to come in, and you're going to smash a vase or hit a kid in the face, unless they come in, in which case, you know, it's sad for them. But, yeah. One of the things I think it relates to, for me, is the idea of having an application in the sense of a space or a context being applied to something. Because we talk about apps, and we forget where the word comes from, but this is an app in the sense of applying oneself to a particular directory structure, and you can make all kinds of different inferences about what application you are considering at a given point. It could be that you're looking in a certain place. It could be that your hands are posed in a certain place. So there will be a number of ways of mediating and making determinations about what to do.<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>The term used earlier, reality modulation, comes into this, because what Brandel was talking about is you can cut a hole to see the reality there, maybe where you have your coffee cup, if you're in a fully VR environment, which is quite useful, or your keyboard. But also, we can pipe in other things, a lot of us have video doorbells like the Ring doorbell, so if you wanted to, you could say, on this wall in your room, where you currently have a picture, a painting, remove the painting and have that doorbell, so you will always see the front of your house, for instance. So the notion of having a window, because a normal window, with VR, would normally be blown out, because there's too much light coming in. So why not replace it with something else? And then you get into, when you're talking about that kind of reality modulation, about different spaces, if you're at a home office, or if you're in an office or a coffee shop, you may still want the same information on walls. But if these are places you use frequently, you can design, you can tell the system, this wall is always for messages, this is always for timeline or whatever it might be. So when you go to the different rooms, it'll shift a bit, but it'll still be mapped onto.<br><b>Stephanie Strickland:&nbsp;</b>But it's always just as much as a window, right? It's not a 180 or 360 view?<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>Well, you can choose. VR normally is a completely synthetic environment, which is either 3D generated or can be based on photographs or whatever you want, so you can choose those. I think, also, the discussion here is, that sometimes you want to know what's in your physical environment, and one aspect of that is simply to see the video of it, another one is to have it rendered in 3D. You won't knock into the desk, because the desk is indicated, but the desk may look completely different. Maybe it looks like you're in a nightclub, or in a jungle, or something, whatever you think might be fun, but you still have the geometry, so that you don't just sit down, you can move around your environment. So there are a lot of options for choices with that. But the thing that I just wanted to mention is, that you talked a little bit about Markdown and so on, which is interesting. So one thing we've discussed here in this group, which is actually part of my PhD thesis, well, it is my PhD thesis, is the notion of Visual-Meta, which is super simple. A PDF document normally doesn't have any metadata. It can, but normally it doesn't. A normal book, one of the first pages, it has a page of printers information, copyright, and so on. Are you familiar with the BibTeX standard for notation? Doesn't matter. So just imagine that you download a PDF, at the last page, there's an appendix that says, Visual-Meta, and then you have, author equals and then a name, date equals and then the date. It can also have the structure of the document, headings, or so-and-so, references, or so-and-so, all these things are there. One of the things that we've discussed, very much with Peter Wasilko’s input, is how that can be extended with further appendices. So a document that goes from your normal word processor with this information into your environment, you can then choose to put let's say, the glossary over here, the references. You do whatever you want. But when you go out, all those spatial representations, which is why it was so great to hear you talk about the coordinates, is then encoded. So you can keep working in a 2D document. Do whatever you want. But when you then go back in your environment again, all these things will snap back into that space.<br><b>Yiliu Shen-Burke:&nbsp;</b>Yeah. On a general level, coming up with some, sort of, legible mapping from something like metadata relations, or some other non-inherently, non-spatial qualities of the 2D media that we work with all the time, so in this case metadata about text or about PDFs, a legible and reliable mapping of that to a 3D representation, or spatial representation that you can manipulate, and you can make sense of and see very clearly in front of you, but then, when you take the headset off, you go back to the original file, those manipulations have resulted in the changes that you expect those manipulations to enact. That is, in general, I think, really going to be a very powerful quality of these spatial interfaces that you will be able to quickly, intuitively, kinaesthetically make sense of this metadata, that usually, on a 2D interface, is at best, just listed out and that works hidden away or doesn't exist at all, as you said.<br><b>Fabien Benetou:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, I was wondering, we discussed about the transition of the boundary between the real or modularization of that. I was wondering, <b>using the inverse of a window, </b>so that you have either your normal display or the e-ink that you stick on the wall and that shows the lens you add to your notes. For example, here you have the mirroring of your Quest, so it's a prompt to dive back and see that space. But I imagine you don't have it always on. But as you have that position in space, you could save it in this space. With the e-ink device, you can even physically print it if you don't think you've done it a lot from a window. And if you have, let's say, the virtual world, that's your point of view of the headset toward that virtual world. And maybe you have a mirror so that I can't put my e-ink here, that would not be very convenient in my office, but if I stick it there on the wall, then I can actually leave it. And it's again, always a problem to reconsider how you organize that space. So I’m wondering if that could be an interest in this area, you have your organized virtual space, because most of us have a desk with documents on it, and that permanence is pretty valuable. And we also have libraries or bookshelves behind us, and we do like to reach behind, and somehow, organize it, another reference we have. So I’m wondering, there is the beauty of having this infinite space you could reconfigure, but somehow, it's hidden away. If you put your Quest on the side, then it's all hidden. You, of course, have your desktop, you can just start with a prototype of just changing the desktop, or having a window there. But I’m wondering how being disconnected from the whole desktop would be interesting, having this virtual permanent window of that organized base? How we would feel? I have no idea, but that should be interesting to try.<br><b>Yiliu Shen-Burke:&nbsp;That's a great term, this a prompt, this little reminder, like a magic window back into this garden.</b> The garden of ideas that you occasionally glance at. I think not now, but it's reminding you, "Okay, it is there." I mean, the practical question of how to access this information when you don't have the headset on you, or if you want to share it with somebody who doesn't have the hardware, I think, that was, very much, the underlying motivation for the experiment I did with the ordinal spatial layout. Because if you have such a layout, what you could do is, for example, always be reading and writing back to a Dropbox folder, and to Markdown files in the Dropbox folder. And many of these note-taking tools like (indistinct) and Obsidian actually just work with Markdown files in exposed folders in their local first applications. And so, if that's the case, then your reminder to go back to the headset could be that you are actually working on the exact same notes, most of the time on your laptop, but when you need to look at a bunch of images... Visual content is really difficult to make sense of in these interfaces. Or when you have just finished doing a brain dump, and you need to see, "How can I, in five minutes, just make sense of all this?" And if you put the headset on, and there is this reversible mapping from the 2D information, the ordinal information, and it's metadata two or three representation, then you can just put the headset on, and be looking at exactly your Obsidian notebook, do some stuff, move some things around, take your headset off, and then, when you in the headset, create a little outline of like, here are the three categories, here the three relations between them. And when you take your headset off, go back to your laptop, it's there. But I think that's a more practical, sort of, you need to be able to do this, for such a tool, to be at all practically usable. But that's separate from, Fabien, your suggestion. And this very lovely, poetic suggestion of having a magic mirror view that's always reminding and subtly updates itself in response to changes that have been happening in the 3D workspace. And it even might just be that, even being able to quickly glance at the global structure, for example, even this thing that we're looking at on the screen right now. I don't really know what it means at the moment, because I haven't really worked in it, as a 3D object for long enough. But if you have worked in it for an hour or two, you might start getting a sense of this cluster of ideas over here, this part of my research means there's a big distance between that and the next cluster. Maybe having something like that, just easily accessible, would be enough to trigger some of these memories that you will have developed working in a 3D space.<br><br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>So you, kind of, almost, made a throwaway remark that this is a little practical thing, or whatever. I think this is probably the most important thing we can discuss. Because we'll look at how best to use it, that will be iteration, testing, and discussing, but how to be able to share it. It is so important to take it in and out. I have a word processor called Author, and Brandel has been kind enough to dig into my files and to provide access to a VR view. So that's a nice little hack that, if we can provide an ecosystem where these things can be used, it is the dream. It would be absolutely fantastically wonderful. I see Keith has joined us, which is lovely. I’m not going to tell anyone where he works... Meta... Anyway, Peter?<br><br><b>Peter Wasilko:&nbsp;</b>Okay. I have a few links on the sidebar. The first link that I dropped in was to an NHK program. It was a cultural heritage piece that had a segment in it on 3D imaging of temples and historical cultural sites to generate VR replicas of them. It's a very nice video to watch. And about, maybe, halfway to two-thirds-ish in for that segment of it. Then, I dropped a link to Mark Bernstein’s essay discussing typed Hypertext links, which also seemed relevant to today's discussion. Then, I included a link to a small excerpt from the 1990s movie Johnny Mnemonic, depicting the use of a VR headset for accessing the internet. And the interesting is, the time scenario was targeted as it being 2021. So it seemed incredibly timely, that back in 1995, they anticipated that 2021 would be the exact time that that technology would be coming online. So you might enjoy watching that short little video clip. Then I put in two links related to BibTeX, and I finished out with a link to Michael Benedikt's paper re-examining some ideas from their seminal book, Cyberspace First Steps, which was an MIT Press book, currently out of print, that I’ve talked about many times in here, which introduced the idea of the unfolding of spaces in VR. So you can be looking at three spatial dimensions that will be associated with three parameters of a higher dimensional object, and you then, be able to select a point within the first three, that would effectively, either correspond to an actual object or to a data point, allowing you to open it to a whole range of other objects that correspond to, basically, having those first three search parameters at the value of the location you set. So, in this case, instead of positioning objects in VR, your positioning is the query to access the higher dimensional object, and then, unfolding it, which was depicted, almost as if, a second cube being opened with half the face cut away so that you're, basically, looking in on an open cut-out slice of a box, in a flipped orientation depicting three additional dimensions. And you'll then be able to do that. Another idea that I’ve been kicking around for a long time in Hypertext systems, would be to have a mirror mode, where you'd be able to reverse the nesting structure that you'd use to traverse to a given point. So you'd be able to effectively turn around and look back up through the containment hierarchy that allowed you to reach the node that you were currently at. And being able to toggle on and off a mirror node, strikes me as a very useful affordance that I have yet to see in any systems I’ve had to work with.<br><b>Yiliu Shen-Burke:&nbsp;</b>I’m going to spend the next week digging into all of these. One point that you mentioned about mapping the actual position, the cartesian position of a node in some values, or some metadata, that's very close to what I’ve been sketching out for prototype number five, or I don't know which number it will be in the end. But a way to represent properties, for example, and there's metadata of these content blocks. For example, if it's a quantitative property, then it's very clear how you might map that to a spatial dimension. But even something like a Boolean, has this image already been edited or has it not, right? You could do all sorts of things in terms of mapping it to positions. You could snap it to one plane or another, depending on the Boolean value. You could also represent the Boolean values true/false as two free-floating nodes, in and of themselves, that try to pull the things that are true closer to themselves, and they try to pull things that are false closer to themselves. And then if you had five, ten, probably at a certain point it would stop making sense, but if you did multiple properties like these, so you did a couple of Boolean properties, you did a couple of like numerical properties, and you just let them all settle into the configuration that the whole system wants to. I mean, it's like a principal component analysis but really rough, and maybe, interactive, manipulable, and really difficult to understand, because it's not, at all, mathematically rigorous. But for some collections of information, maybe you're writing a paper and you start adding some quantitative properties, or toggle properties to things, and you just want to see, "Okay, I’m kind of stuck here. I just want the system to tell me what shape can these bits of information take if I prioritize these properties or de-prioritize those other ones." That's definitely something I’m thinking about for prototype number five. But that's another parallel track altogether. I just wanted to kick it back to everybody a little bit, because Frode sent an email a couple of weeks ago talking about the question of how to relate text and information more generally in a 3D environment, one to another. Either the question of like literally the visual representation of the relations between things or a more conceptual level. So something that I’m struggling with, but definitely I’m in the thick of it, at the moment, with prototype zero four is how to represent, and how to think about the relations between blocks and text to each other, blocks of text to topics, blocks of text to multimedia, like images or URLs. Stephanie made a very good point that either all relations are references because it's a reference, but then, you should specify what kind of reference it is. Or references but one of many possible kinds of relations. I have a lot of conversations with people about semantic triples, in relation to semantic web, recently, but specifically to text, which is very slippery as well. It's natural language. There's interpretation involved. How have you all been thinking about, or what examples have you seen of ways to relate things? I’m thinking all the way back from Ted Nelson's, Xanadu style transclusion indicators, to, I don't know, something like this prototype I’m showing here, with these radial links and lines.<br><br><b>Fabien Benetou:&nbsp;</b>I<b>&nbsp;</b>want to step back just a bit on, it's going to sound a bit harsh, I find your work very interesting, but I’m probably never going to use it because I need to make it myself. I think the research you do is interesting, but I don't think you can explore all of it. And some, for example, of my quirky ideas, I think nobody is going to explore. But why I find and rightfully so, but I still going to explore it. And then, that's also why I like programming, is because I can have some really strange ideas, and maybe, nobody should explore them, because it's going to be useless for them, but I want to be able to do that. So the problem I have is, if I use somebody else's system, at some point, I get stuck. I don't want to reinvent the whole wheel, and I, obviously, can't even do that. So what I’m going into here is some of the idea both of us have, some of the ideas are not shared. One of the beauty of the power of tools like Notion or all the PKM-PIM trend of the moment, is also that some of the effort is being distributed through the community. So I’m just wondering, are the components, patterns, or things for example that make Unity so famous or popular that we should do together? That we, as a community, should have,&nbsp; maybe, I don't know, implementing some way to explore Dropbox or Google Drive or whatnot, we don't have to keep on re-implementing that? Or maybe, some way to spatialize? We don't have to so. I’m just thinking it completely naively. I don't have an answer to this, but I’m wondering:<br>	What are the things we should re-implement from scratch because we need to dig there and there is no answer? <br>	What are the things we should not reimplement? <br>	Do you have some patterns? <br>	Do you have some plugins, or a cookbook, or recipes that you want to rely on, that also, maybe, you don't want to explore because you don't find interesting, but you know it could be interesting and you want to rely on this? <br>	So I’m wondering, at the larger scale, a community of people who are interested in managing knowledge, writing, or reading text here, how can we be a bit more strategical about the work we can do?<br><b>Yiliu Shen-Burke:&nbsp;</b>That's an excellent question. And I think answering this question is going to make all the difference in whether things like what I’m building, can become useful. Nothing good enough that there is mainstream adoption or not. I mean, I think the shorthand answer is open sourcing some or all parts of these projects. I’m in conversation with Brian Eppert of Noda, which is a VR mind mapping application. He's brought up a lot of similar points, which is like, we are all either reinventing the wheel, or we're relying on very poorly adapted frameworks that come from the gaming world, where, essentially, you're given options to fire weapons at your PBS. And there probably is a lot of, well, I would say there's going to be increasing duplicated effort. Now that it seems that people are actually tackling this class of applications seriously, I would say, even a couple of years ago, there wasn't necessarily much duplication because everyone was only making games in VR. So often I had things like, I had to re-implement, by hand, an image processing library, and I had to implement, by hand, an image texturing LOD system. TextMeshPro is already pretty good, but I had to definitely tweak that a lot to make it usable. And so there are a lot of these things that if you're like developing a web app, you would never, ever, in a million years, in 2022, want to build by yourself because there you'll have a thousand excellent libraries already available. And that's just not where we are. But I think, not duplicating effort while, as you're saying, being mindful of the areas where it's productive to just dig on your own because there's much more there than has already been discovered, balancing between those two. But I think, I’ve just moved so much more slowly than I would have liked, with building the first version of the app, version 2020, the one with the big white room, because of the need to just reinvent a lot of these building blocks that exist in abundance in other platforms. I have many of them now in the toolbox, and that's been great, and that's one of the factors. And these prototypes I’ve been showing you, I started building in February, and so I’m quite happy. I could be faster, but I’m pretty happy with how quickly they've come together. In large part because I had done years and years of work. The pinch, the spatial cursor thing took, I don't know how many months to really figure out and built, and that's the kind of thing that I also would be happy to promote as an alternative paradigm to the larger community. I mean, there are issues with it, we have to tweak and all this stuff. But just as an alternative to the laser pointer, which just has so many issues, both ergonomic and conceptual. To me it's a mock weapon, right? Those are examples of things I’d be more than happy to have other people adopt, offer feedback on, and if it's open source, to other people to improve on at a much faster rate than one party would be able to do. So Fabien, basically, yes, let's talk about that because I absolutely don't want to reinvent the entire operating system from scratch.<br><br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>I share your frustration about doing something commercial, and also being part of a community. It's really hard to decide what's going to be your secret sauce, so to speak. And what has to be shared. My initial feeling with what you're doing here is, data in and out should be shared and working on protocols, that people should be able to choose your environment and you have your amazing interactions. It's a stressful and longer discussion. <br><br><b>Brandel Zachernuk:&nbsp;</b>Awesome. So in <b>an answer to your question of how you apply spaces and attributes to data, </b>I dropped a link in the chat to a researcher, who used to be at the University of Monash, now at the University of Queensland, Maxime Cordeil. <br>	He did these immersive analytics, actually, I’ve shown in this group before, but it's really phenomenal, in terms of being able to show multivariate data. And more generally, one of the things that I think is really valuable, is having the ability to really, rapidly, and substantially alter the arrangement layout and visual appearance with gestural manipulation that has a quick and one-to-one impact in terms of scaling things, or moving things, or colouring things, changing aspects of their objects velocity. Those things that are the most detectable to us, in a lizard brain kind of way, but once that we can, actually, modify and sculpt the presentation. Which is, somewhat, at odds with another really important thing for us, which is the persistent speciality aspect. but there are interesting ways of trying to square that circle for individuals doing different things. The question that I had for you was, with all of these prototypes, including back to 2020, but also your one through four, have you sat with them, used them, and thought about the impact that they have on what you do? <br>	Like with this beautiful tree view, and I’d love for you to move your headset around, and talk a little bit, especially for Bob, because he became about what this is, I think you'll get a kick out of it. Has it changed what you think of, or how you understand what these things are, and what you want to do with them, as a consequence?<br><b>Yiliu Shen-Burke:&nbsp;</b>That's a great question. So to eat my own dog food, on a practical level, can I use these tools I’m building to, actually, do some very minimal amount of the work that I proposing people to use them for. And so the blog posts that I published for prototypes two and three I wrote, the first drafts are in the prototypes themselves. And prototype two, I wish I didn't show you because it was a really dumbed-down version of prototype three, totally focused on text editing and writing. <br>	<b>My benchmark for success for that one was if I could sit for one hour and just write. </b>And at first, I thought I could qualify this with like, “Oh, can I write well? Or can I write X number of words?” It actually turns out that, <b>if you can't write comfortably and productively, you're going to stop after 30 seconds,</b> because it's just the most frustrating thing in the world to try to write something with interfaces getting in your way or whatever. And once I got to the point where I could actually write, and it was like, an 800-word draft I think, and published, it was 1200 with additional comments and images. Once I got to one hour mark I knew, “Okay, that's pretty good for me. I’ve surprised myself, that I’m convinced you can write comfortably in your VR headset.” Which, again, I was very scared of the answer to that question when I embarked on that process. <br><b>	The higher level question of, have I changed how I think about what this is, what this information is? Absolutely. </b><br><br><b>Itemized OS</b><br><br>	And this is all just making me want to go back to work and finish building prototype four, because, are any of you familiar with Alexander Obenauer's Itemized OS? I will post that in the chat. So the <b>Itemized OS is a proposed paradigmatic design for a computer operating system, where the lowest level primitive is an atomic item which can be any, sort of, block of content.</b> So a block of text, an image, a PDF. It can also be a composite of those things. So you can have a calendar event that's a text at a time, et cetera. And these atomic units are infinitely, flexibly recombinable into different configurations, and they can be contained, and the containers can have certain logic about what they do to the containees, but the&nbsp;containees&nbsp;are only ever temporarily contained within the container. It's not that if you delete the container all the items go away, as well. So, I guess, one of the differences between the&nbsp;Itemized&nbsp;OS and the OSs that we actually use, that are actually out in the world, is that items have a primacy that files and folders don't. And files and folders have a definite location on your computer. The containment structure is a tree. And the&nbsp;Itemized&nbsp;OS it's a full graph. You can have any sort of (indistinct) pointing any which ways. Which, to me, does sound a little bit overwhelming, potentially for someone who just wants to check their email, and make sure they get to their (indistinct) on time with their calendar app. But maybe as an underlying layer that would give power users or developers all this flexibility that they currently don't have, it's not a bad idea. And all the examples that Alexander Obenauer gives, and especially the visual mock-ups he's created of how this would work in the 2D environment always run into this problem of views, so give you a very concrete example, I think one of his examples is, you receive an email with a calendar invitation in it, and in the Itemized OS, the calendar invitation would be its own item that you can move into your calendar, and the calendar invitation has this existence independent of the email that arrived in, and the calendar view that you're seeing in relative to other events. And in the mock-ups, you see the email as a window with the event in it. And then, you see the calendar window with the event in it. And you're always jumping between these views, even if the data is living in the same spot, in IPFs or whatever this is. The way the interface represents this is as different things that are in different locations, because you know from the physical world, we've learned that a cup that is in my apartment right now, cannot be the same thing as a cup that is in Brandel's apartment, because, almost by definition, that makes them different cups. Whereas, in the Itemized OS, they can, and should be the same item. And so, with Prototype04, right now, the missing step is that that document container is actually just another type of item that has been expanded, and has pulled in all the other items that are contained in it. You could collapse it, and then, everything goes back to the force director graph structure. Or open up another container that would, then, temporarily take over the layout. And all the items that it contained would, for brush into it, and so you have this literal continuity of existence of items, which have a canonical representation of each canonical thing. And the reason why I’m calling all these things projects is because I have no idea if this is a good idea or not, actually, in practice. But I’m pretty sure, in some use cases, it is an excellent idea. And a concrete one is coming from architectural design, I have a lot of early users who are architects themselves, because I harass them into using SoftSpace. <br>	And when you're doing visual research, you're doing report, you don't want to, actually, duplicate... Images are interesting because they are very immutable, they rarely change. So you really have one image, and you don't want to make a copy, because you're not going to make changes to that image if you move it into a folder or if you want to reference it in a different part of your project. It's the same image. It's the same core idea. <br>	And so for mood boarding, as a use case, or for any visual heavy research, this ability to, actually, see the same idea represented by a canonical visual representation of it, moving between the different places where it is playing a role in your project, I hope, I think could be very powerful and actually useful. So this is something that has only occurred to me, Brandel, as a response to your question, after having played with my prototype three, and then asking... I had a call with Conor White-Sullivan at Roam, and we butted heads over references, containment, and things, and afterward, I realized, “No, Conor is right.” I just couldn't see the possibilities that my prototype was presenting, just because I was so stuck in the items in folders living in only one place, and therefore, to show that thing somewhere else it had to be a sim link, or it had to be some other type of relation. But, actually, no, it could just be the same kind of relationship of being contained in something, or not contained, but referenced in something. So, yeah, that's one small example. I hope to find more. But also, the reason why I’m really excited about this one, in particular, is because I’m wary of these insights that might come to me, that only occur to someone who has worn a headset and tried these things. But the fact that I’ve come to this idea for certain information architecture, and then I find examples of it, not only in contemporary writings, like&nbsp;Alexander Obenauer's,&nbsp;&nbsp;but also going all the way back to transclusion. What's&nbsp;transclusion?&nbsp;This is transclusion, right? That makes me really excited, though, it feels like, okay, this is two ends of the donut finally coming together. We had the conceptual possibility and the technical possibility. And one was really far away from the other, but now they're finally able to touch.<br><br><b>Bob Horn:&nbsp;</b>I’m interested in several topics back now, and if I’m mistaken, please, just pass on to what you're interested in. But I thought I heard that Yiliu was interested in the relationships between different parts of text that might have to do with content that goes beyond metadata? And if that is a topic, then, I would be interested in having a conversation about that.<br><b>Yiliu Shen-Burke:&nbsp;</b>Absolutely. Just to frame it a little bit, and Bob, I want to hear what you have to say on this topic. But the framing is this, which is, if you go looking for information on the semantic web on the internet, as I did, you come across this core concept of the semantic triple, which is, an object, a predicate, and a subject. So Eve eats the apple, or whatever. And to me, and the semantic web painted this picture of a web that was, basically, full of these semantic triples, and you could do all this processing, querying, and automatic deduction based on these semantic triples. But what always struck me is this like, people who work on semantic web themselves acknowledge, is that, it's obviously very labour intensive, every single relation between one thing and another has to be clearly, manually defined. And then, all these questions are made up of aliasing, what if the verb and the noun version of that concept should really be the same thing? Or just gets really messy, really quickly. And also it was unclear to me, in the system, what level of abstraction this meaning should really live? Is it something that's very low-level, technical, pervasive, machine legible? Or on the other end of the spectrum, is it something that is almost, by definition, human and poetic and it will vary subtly from one speaker of the language to another and be completely open to interpretation? Which is why I think for example, Roam, and its, sort of, clones have settled on this typeless reference, where you just point a block of text to some other concept, and there's just this directed reference, and there isn't a way to get, I don't know if it's in the works, to define what kind of reference that might be. Whether it is supporting evidence, refuting evidence, or an instance of something, et cetera. So then it got me thinking, "Okay, well." One is, if that were the case, if you did have typed references, does having a spatial interface open a new possibility for representing them? For example, you have a line from the object block to the subject block in this line with the predicate displayed in the middle. That's a very simple example. Is that even useful or would that be overwhelming? And then I thought, "Well, maybe we're thinking about it backwards. Maybe the block of text, itself, is the predicate." Normally you would be writing a sentence like, "Yiliu works in VR." This is a sentence in the text block, and Yiliu might be one topic, and VR might be another topic. And it might actually be that Yiliu is the object, VR is the subject, and this messy, squishy natural language content object, which is not typed at all, it is what it is, it's literally that unique string of characters, is the relation, is the predicate from one to the other, and therefore, from one to the other it could be every place where those two concepts are ever mentioned in the same paragraph. That paragraph is a predicate. And then, you could take another level and say, any place where there's an indirect relation, it's also a deducible predicate between Yiliu works in VR, VR is an emerging technology, in which case Yiliu has this relation to emerging technologies. And then, once I got thinking of that, then I just thought, "Well, I’m not going to try to make sense of this. What if it were all just a force-directed graph and you could visually see it as being connected from the Yiliu node, to the VR node, to the emerging technologies node?" And I don't know what exactly that would mean, but it would mean something. And you would be able to concretely look at it, and do something with it. But I don't know. And that's just the train of thought that I’ve gone through. And I’m sure there's been a lot more work and research in this area that I’m not aware of. So I’m very happy to get pointers, references, and ideas.<br><b>Bob Horn:&nbsp;</b>What I’ve heard you saying is that there are maybe structures that have already been discovered that relate chunks of text that, maybe, one sentence to seven to nine sentences. Which is what I saw in your demo. The answer is, yes, there are such things. They were invented 50 years ago or more by me. There are, for example, in stable subject matters, the kind that exists in textbooks, procedures policies, and documentation, training materials in business, there are 40 such structures with a few loose ones at the end, some others. But 40 stable ones, they've been used in business industry and government for the last 50 years. When I left being CEO and Chairman of that company that sold them, we had trained 400.000 technical writers in business, in 30 countries, around the world. They all paid for this information. So that's one structure. I sold the company long ago, 30 years ago, and I presume it still exists. So, anyway, there are other structures that relate text like that. There are about 15 to 20 that I could tell you about, and outline. And there are a bunch more that need a lot of intellectual work to improve human thinking.<br><b>Frode Hegland:&nbsp;</b>So on that note, we have come up to the two-hour mark.

Thus, virtual reality technologies (henceforth VRTechs) turn such text into experiences that make readers to interactively feel a sort of bodily astral projection couple with emotional trajectory into oneiric world. In other words, VRTechs algorithmically convert coincided literary utopias of an author into vivid experiences through Artificial Intelligence (AI), brainpower signals and the non-invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). Bansal and Mahajan rightly confirm that Facebook, which is now, Meta, has already advertised in April 2017 the development of its mind-controlled non-invasive BCI for typing using brain signals in order to make typing fivefold faster than usual by applying a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals to scan the brain many times within some moments so as to translate thoughts to text (5) on digital platforms just like the generative Artificial Intelligence that translates text to gif (T2G), text to 3D (T2D) simulation, text to motion (T2Mo), text to image (T2I), text to code (T2C), text to video (T2V), text to NFT (T2N) and text to music (T2M), we shall have thought to text (Th2T) in the VR.<br>	VR textual experience is equally an ekphrastic form of technological induced phantasmagorical, hypnotic and hallucinatory reading that capture readers’ soul, spirit and body then glue them to particular physical location at the same time whilst they are immersed in reading the text. In fact, the future 3D texts in VR will print automatically from the authors or readers’ brain and mind into the metaversal ecosystem in a matter of moments while they engage themselves in imaginary creative thoughts influenced by the text read or its prompts. <br>	Therefore, text in VR could be reified like gravel fetched by bricklayer to mould blocks. Thus, it will be seen, fetched and felt. It is obvious that digital poetics must be redefined to fit metaversal VR text environment.<br>	The digital poetics of metaversal literary text requires necessarily the knowledge of blockchain art or crypto art, three.js or babylon.js (JavaScript libraries), Web Graphic Library (WebGL), WebVR including Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML) to produce the procedural creative works. Nevertheless, the disadvantage of such procedural creative works in the Metaverse could be interactively hacked by hackers in order to manipulate readers’ thought pattern to suite some philosophical and religious belief contrary to their original belief systems. This art is called “neuropsychological hacking”. In lay man language, “ brain and mind  hacking”. Consequently, there is a tendency, in the future, authors and content developers of immersive storytelling may manipulate readers' propensity directly by editing 3D VR text while integrating with it via the optical head mounted display ( OHMD).<br><h1 id="04105ABF-6E96-45E6-9F1C-B87E0B9718F1">Stephen Fry</h1><br><br><center><h2 id="8FB9FF61-43EA-4176-A7F1-2A5B71D1CC25">In closing: A Prediction</h2><br></center><br>Language has the astonishing capacity to send and receive pictures, ideas and full dramatic scenarios to and from the minds of those who use it. Artificial Intelligence seems now to be developing the ability to do something similar - convert language into images. Dall-E and Midjourney are, at the time of writing, popular free examples of this. How text will be integrated in, exploited or harnessed by AR/VR and the like is an open question, but this new, or at least newly celebrated, capability of AI must, one presumes, be a part of it. <br>	But we only have to look back to realise how unknowable a future it is. Midjourney’s very name should remind us that technology is always moving. <br>	When I first showed friends a smartphone in the 90s (a Nokia Communicator or Sony Ericsson, probably) they thought them slow, cumbersome and consequently without apparent use. <br>	Twitter would suffer routinely in its first five to ten years from server outages, and cause DDoS type crashes to other sites if you sent too many people there. <br>	The apparent flakiness of the technology caused people to miss the real point of what such technologies could actually do to our species socially, psychologically, culturally - existentially. They were so hung up on the primitive early rollouts that they couldn’t see what the implications were. <br>	I say “they” I mean “we” of course, because I was as blind as everyone else. <br>	Then again, who looked at early Karl Benz automobiles and foresaw Formula One racing, four lane highways, multi-storey carparks, EVs, adaptive cruise control, drive through burger joints, decades of brain damage in children from gasoline lead-poisoning and rising pollution and climate change? They just saw noisy machines that were only for the rich, which required either a skilled chauffeur/mechanic, or a fair deal of knowledge concerning chokes, carburettors, jets, magnetos, spark plugs, double-declutching and the lord knows what else, just to drive a few miles. <br>	Who looked at Twitter, Facebook etc and foresaw the maelstrom of convergent storm systems that has swept like a destructive tornado through so much of human intercourse and comity over recent years? <br><br><hr style="width:10%;">It’s hard to trust any predictions from anyone. But just as the “paperless office” is a sick joke to anyone working in real offices, so is the idea of “keyboardless computer interfacing” - both always just around the corner, but always defied by our human liking (when it comes to virtual communication at least) for manipulating the visual symbols of language rather than deploying vocal utterance, text rather than speech. Yes, we have FaceTime and Zoom, but most people hate them and only use them to please their bosses or their mothers. We’d rather write a letter (as we should call emails now, surely?), or send a WhatsApp/iMessage. I suspect this will be just as true for those who like the idea of stepping into Zuckerberg’s Metaverse or wander about wearing digital spectacles of some kind of other… <br>	My only prediction is that everyone’s predictions will be wrong. Including mine of course. <br>	With this pleasing paradox, I will leave you.<br><br><center><img id="7833CB4F-C721-4852-A10D-7D38F7CABF13" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/8E3A5BE2-661A-4FA3-A260-8792F85E7BC4.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br><br><br><h1 id="43D3C7A4-00B0-4BFC-BF93-3342497D3B0F">Appendix : History of Text Timeline</h1><br><br>This timeline is included partly as a resource to look through, but also as an extra data point for when you might look up text in the document with a Find command and the associated dates will then also appear.<br>	We understand that this will never be, nor aims to be, a complete and accurate history of text.

He simply asked: “what if in your office, you as an intellectual worker, were supplied with a computer display, backed up by a computer which was alive for you all day, instantly responsive to every action you have, <b>how much value could you derive from that?”†</b><br>	We have spent the last 54 years asking questions about what the responsive computer could give us. It is fair to say that computers have increased by orders of magnitude in performance since then, but they have still not managed to live up to what Doug’s imagination saw possible. We must keep asking, but with volume 3 of<i> The Future of Text,</i> we have been focusing <b>not on the computer, but on the computer display. </b><br><br><h3 id="4421949A-31B1-405D-902E-D32A42F45537">State of the art</h3><br><br>As I write some of these words in my headset, a Meta Quest Pro, a few days before launch day, <b>I am in a–let’s be honest–crudely presented coffee shop and I am typing on the physical keyboard of my Apple MacBook Pro. </b>I can see my hands in a pass-through video window but the pass-through is not clear enough to allow me to see the keys, it’s all still quite rough. <br>	This is why I do not use pass-through video in general, it’s simply too noisy with too much jitter. But never mind, it will get better.<br>	<b>I am writing in my word processor Author,</b> which I named in honour of Doug and his ‘augmentation’ philosophy (‘Author’ and ‘Augment’ have the same etymological roots).<br> <b>	I double-tap on my headset for full pass-through for a moment </b>to see my coffee cup on the table and a take a sip. I still have easy access to the normal world but with another double-tap I am away back in the virtual coffee shop. <br>	<b>There are many niggles</b> with the way I can work in a headset now, such as the time and hassle it is to connect my laptop to the virtual environment – the inflexible ways monitors are handled and so on, but let’s just assume this will be improved in the future to be transparently simple.<br>	<b>What is clear, already, is how clear the environment already is. </b>Sure, the text I am reading is not as sharp as on the retina display on my laptop, but it is also not bad at all. I have the benefit of a large display which goes beyond what a large physical display could do, such as being a third the way down into the table I am typing on–I do not have to think about physical space to think about what is comfortable to write on. <br>	<b>All I am doing currently however, is living in a traditional digital environment with a larger screen. </b>While I find the tech impressive, the gaming immersive and social experiences convincing,<b> I have not had much experience with knowledge work in the headset</b> since there is not much software available beyond the virtual displays. <br><br>[At this point I think it’s worth pointing out that I think terms ‘VR’, ‘AR’ and even ‘XR’ will not enter mainstream. I think people will refer to this as<b> working in a ‘headset’ or maybe through specific brand names. </b>We will see. Soon enough]<br><br><h3 id="0686CF3B-B355-49C1-9095-77E45BF373AF">What is this space?</h3><br><br>Going into VR is somewhat <b><i>back to the future,</i></b> as Fabien mentioned at the symposium. We used to work at room scale, with papers all over our desks and with whiteboards and so on, then, as our work became more digital, we started doing more and more in rectangles measured in inches, from a large-ish 27” display to 13” laptops screens and 5” smartphone screens. <b>We are now reclaiming space.</b><br>	But this time the space is not limited by physical constraints, <b>it will only be limited by our imagination.</b><br>	We can soon put posters up on the walls without the delay and cost of printing. Or indeed, buying and placing monitors.<br>	We can soon open our digital ‘books’ (and I say ‘books’ in quotes), even though they may look like facsimiles of digital PDF type documents or printed documents, <b><i>and let them fly.</i></b><br> 	Someone said that during the 1968 demo it looked like Doug was flying through cyberspace with both hands at the controls, with his mouse and his chorded keyset. This is not a bad metaphor for how we will live and work in the headsets.<br>	Soon we will really fly through our information with both hands at the controls, really using our hands, where the finesses of how we move our hands having as much impact on the stuff of knowledge as they would have on a physical clay model. Doug invented the mouse and the chorded keyset but his sights were set much higher, to a control system we are getting close to being able to implement.<br>	Soon.<br><h3 id="5645744B-F9D7-4F1E-BA77-CDF82B2A4B77">Change</h3><br><br>Soon we will be able to open a book, like our own <i>Future of Text,</i> maybe volume 4?, and all the images in the book will populate spaces in our real world, on AR augmented walls, murals can expand to entire walls, embedded timelines will appear as we want them to: as Tron style neon tubes or paper cut-outs of historical moments, whatever we want. <br>	Maps will be rendered on the table in 3D or at 1-1 scale for close inspection. <br>	Soon.<br><br><h3 id="0503BE84-4E63-489F-818B-0D172AAE1C0D">Soon the environments of books will change</h3><br><br>Soon we will be reading academic documents where<b> citations will, Ted Nelson style, leap out of the books</b> to their sources, which will be accessible for us at the turn of a hand or a flick of a wrist.<br>	Libraries will be <b>presented and re-presented, any way we want. </b><br>	If we’d like to enter the Library of Congress, or the National Library of France, we can step right in. <br>	Would it be better for you if the books were organised in a different way? No problem. Would you like to see the books arranged by which one cites which? Maybe you’d like to see the people behind the books and how they relate? That can be done. <br>	Soon books will be but one way of binding information together in a coherent and robust form and information will become truly liquid, as will our interactions.<br>	Soon.<br><br><h3 id="1BA8B4C1-293E-44E8-A4D1-56BC127ED62A">But only if we have the technical infrastructures</h3><br><br>This and much more can only be done <b><i>if</i></b> <b>the infrastructures are there.</b> By this I primarily mean the metadata to describe what everything is and how it connects. Otherwise we will be working with what might as well just be JPGs. Pretty, but inert. Un-interactive. <br>	In the Future Text Lab, and for my PhD, we have been working on making the metadata elevated to the same level as the data. After all, metadata is really just data which says what other data is, something Ted Nelson made me realise. <br>	Metadata, metadata. It might sound boring and it might sound techy but let me repeat: <b>Metadata is the data which describes what data is.</b> That makes it gold dust.<br>	In academia, if you publish only plain text you are only publishing the tip of the iceberg of your knowledge work. Why hide the possibilities of making yourself more deeply understood? Why strip away the semantic formatting of your paper, why make citations hard to follow and why make your work hard to cite?<br><br><h3 id="C401BA0E-8E5F-4C71-8261-D4D1969A9114">This book, with metadata</h3><br><br>I’d like to show you what metadata makes possible by interacting with our book as a simple PDF. <br>	This is our book in full, published in PDF. However, it features a <b>Visual-Meta Appendix. </b><br>	Visual-Meta was the result of my PhD thesis and it simply states what the document is, at the back of the document.<br>	It is written in a very simple format using the academic standard BibTeX style.<br>	The result is that, in our seven hundred plus page book we can navigate much quicker and more conveniently than through page by page or typing in a page number, because we built a PDF viewer called ‘Reader’ which understands Visual-Meta.<br>	For example:<br><li><b>When we go through the book page by page,</b> sometimes we want to skip to the next author, so instead of arrow right for the next page, which can take quite a while to skip past longer articles, we do arrow down on our keyboard and that skips to the next top level heading, the next article. It can do that precisely because the book has the metadata to describe where the headings are.</li><br><b>We can pinch into an outline at any time.</b><br><li><b>If I highlight text, then pinch,</b> I can see it in the outline.</li><br><li><b>I can select text and Find</b> every occurrence of that text which is shown with two grey lines above and below, for context.</li><br><li><b>If I select text and Find and that text has a defined glossary term attached, </b>the glossary definition appears at the top of the page. If there is something in bold in this definition, that means this text also has a definition so I can click on it to read that definition.</li><br><b>If I want to cite</b> something from the book, I simply copy it, then go to the Author word processor and paste and it pastes as a full citation. <br><li>&amp; more, such as clicking on a citation to see the source.</li><br>To be clear, all this is possible because of the easy to read and easy to parse metadata conveniently placed at the back of the book.<br><br><h3 id="FEB3DB7B-BA14-403C-9167-9736B2545637">Fabien, the next step</h3><br><br>Fabien has taken the book further, he has taken it into VR, with not only beautifully readable pages, but also with computational text. The system is called SpaSca (spatial scaffolding). He will make a brief demo after these remarks.<br><br><h3 id="9E0528A2-2CB4-488C-AE1E-D836932A99F6">Join us</h3><br><br>I firmly believe that the future of<b> text has the potential to truly augment how we think and communicate. </b><br>	I firmly believe that we must use what we have now to work to solve the problems we have now-we cannot wait for some hypothetical neural implant or have discussions of how the future will be all about video or voice or whatever it might be. <br>	<b>Today</b> we are celebrating the future of text-so I don’t think I have to spend too much time selling the potential of text and I hope that <b>we are collectively waking</b> up to <b>the potential of text freed from the constraints of the frame of the page.</b><br><br><b>Today I invite you</b> all to join us in <b>wondering what a future working, particularly with text, in these headset can be like, if we DREAM.</b> Doug said that dreaming is hard, and he was not kidding. Without the experiments and experience, our dreams stay vague and undefined.<br>	We <i>must</i> dream, we simply cannot afford to let <b><i>this one single opportunity </i></b>of being <b>the only people in history</b> who are alive–and hopefully present–at the start of this visually immersive world. This is a truly <b>momentous moment in history</b>.<br><b>This is the last time in the history of humanity when we will not have headsets as a regular part of our work tools.</b><br><b>	We cannot afford to simply accept </b>the functionality which the giant computer companies will give us. <br>	Their focus is to augment their bottom line.<br>	Our focus is to augment our highest potential.<br>To dream productively we need to think, discuss, build experiments, experience them, discuss and build again. In other words we need to build something which will help us build something more useful tomorrow. <b>We need to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, </b>as Doug would often say. And once the giant companies have given us their modes of interaction, it will be hard to invent something else with what reality being present.<br><br><h3 id="7ECBD62E-D243-4E74-BCBF-A3C3EAD6E9DA">Only if we have the mental infrastructures</h3><br><br><b>Do we have the ‘</b><b><i>will’</i></b><b> to do this?</b><br>	Can we really dream ourselves a better future? “If there is a will, there is a way” we like to say.<br>	However, on the issue of free will Arthur Schopenhauer wrote in the early 1800s in a Norwegian magazine, that “man can do what he wills, but he cannot will what he wills” <a href="http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=FOeEas9TdH8C&amp;hl=&amp;source=gbs_api">(Schopenhauer, 2012)</a>. In other words we may want something, but <b>do we have control of the internal and external forces which sets the scene for what we want?</b><br><b>	If we are to leverage</b> our creativity, curiosity and common focus, we need to look not only at the technical infrastructures we will need to shape, but also the <b>social and psychological infrastructures </b>which will help us dream ‘better’.<br><br>In a world of climate change, serious income inequality, a major war in Europe, a stubborn pandemic and a cost of living crisis, <b>it is clear that we do need to look at improving how we think and communicate, </b>but as a species we seem to lack the imagination and drive to do this.<br><br>In addition to working to improve our world in specific areas, we need to focus on what <b><i>we think with</i></b> and <b><i>what we communicate with </i></b>and I would say part of that <b>is text.</b><br>	We will need to foster an appreciation for what text can do for us and help people see that even though text was invented and developed eons ago, we still draw great benefit from it’s compactness, flexibility, robustness and ability to extend and connect our minds.  <br>	The potential of<b> digital text </b>is largely untapped. <b>The potential of digital text in VR is hardly even appreciated as being a thing. <br></b>	We now have a chance to demonstrate to people that text unleashed can be something magical, something deeply powerful to help us think–not to remove thinking from us like AI will partly do. That’s another issue, another symposium, another book.<br>	If we can collectively raise awareness of the power of richly interactive text through the emergence of VR, which the public currently has both excitement and cynicism about–but at least there is a strong public awareness that it <i>might</i> be the next big thing–then we can use this to power a shift to more people, more companies developing <b>the will and interest </b><b><i>to work to augment what text is.</i></b><br>	Doug did the first heavy lifting with his <b>Augmentation Research Center </b>and changed the world.<br>	We are trying to do this in a modest way, in the<b> Future Text Lab</b> and next year I hope we will be able to take up up a notch. <br><br><h3 id="556FBBE2-7B83-401F-95C8-962B032D720A">The future?</h3><br><br>In closing, something a little more concrete. My wishes for a future of text in headsets is simple as far as I am concerned:<br><li><b>In the near term </b>I think I can reasonably expect to put on a headset and work with virtual screens instantly available. </li><br><li><b>In the longer term</b> I want to have rich metadata enabling interactions I can only barely imagine today.</li><br><li><b>This image is the current view of our book’s Defined Concepts</b> in the Map view in Author, the same data which is exported as Glossary, as you saw earlier. </li><br><li>By end of 2023 I dream to see this information in a multi-wall AR or VR experience where the third dimension really provides a benefit. </li><br><li>Maybe there will author names in a column or two on one wall, citations on another, locations on a globe and so on, and the ‘book’ (again in ‘quotes’) itself <b>the object these concepts revolve around,</b> represented as a magical facsimile of the printed book <b>to explode into explorations at will.</b></li><br><br><center><img id="03D716FE-4041-4471-A0FB-B3E296AA4008" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/E3E82AF4-E702-40F6-A421-6ACB5A703FA2.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br><h3 id="AD99A2A3-2C22-4F44-A424-9BFA3260C121">Thank you</h3><br><br>I thank you, so many of you, for having contributed to the book &amp; the dialog over the year and I thank you all for being here today. <br>	I would particularly like to thank my co-curators Vint Cerf, Ismail Serageldin, Mark Anderson, Dene Grigar and Claus Atzenbeck.<br>	And thank you for your patience in listening to this, I look forward to our discussions today and in the future, a discussion which will be recorded and included as a transcript in the book, the actual publication will Friday the	16th. Today the book is final but this addition will be added next week before the book is made publicly available.<br><b>	So I ask you: </b>what if in your office, you as an intellectual worker, were supplied with a fully immersive computer display, backed up by a super computer, <b>what would you like this to be?</b><br><i><br></i><b><i>Frode Hegland</i></b><i><br>London 9th of December 2022</i><br><br><br><hr style="width:10%;"><h2 id="AFBC9D9F-B029-4C9F-A3B8-DE81DAF9A52A">Discussion</h2><br><br><i>Edited for clarity and for brevity, some sections of non-pertinent discussion have been omitted.

I have a couple of highlights I thought for us to think about from that is <b>the notion of highest potential</b>. That was a good point to bring up. What can we do to to be the best we can be in terms of humanity? When you showed that final image and I was thinking, of Tom Phillips’ Humument† so you call that ‘messy’. But actually that looked like what Humument was trying to get to with the overlay of text. So some of you aren’t familiar with that. It’s Tom Phillips’ famous work. <br>	And then finally, the idea of living in a headset. None of us are. Just few of us are wearing a headset right now in this environment. But I’m thinking about the kinds of social experiences that will come out of that, and one of which could be a complete focus on an assist immersion into something, right, which is the opposite of what people are saying computers do to us now. There’s the idea that we’re scattered, we’re not thinking in a focused way. <br>	Headsets will help focus that. I also think if we’re going to do that, it needs to be multi-use because we don’t become isolated from each other. So if we’re in a headset experiencing something, we need to be with other people wearing headsets, experiencing something so that we don’t isolate our communities and disconnect from other people. Once again, getting back to our highest potential because part of being human is being social, right? But thank you for those comments. Those are just some responses.<br>[<b>Frode Hegland</b>]: Yeah. Thank you for that, Dene. I agree with that. And sometimes we do need to get away from other people. So I’ve been talking to someone this week about reading, and sometimes you just need a private reading space to get away. And VR can be beautiful for that too. So one of the key things I found with battling within our Future Text Lab over there and it’s been really passionate, has been that at some point we’ll be floating like angels, so to speak, but before then we will still have rectangles and things. But even just dealing with the rectangles and things where we do it and how we do it is a really big deal. And to have something like an actual book club really mundane in the VR environment where you read, but you have people of a similar persuasion, reading similar thing might be good. So how we go in there absolutely important. But also it can be so immersive and we’re there all by ourselves and our flow and our labs that we, you know, you really take the headset off and you really appreciate being in the regular world again. So it’s going to be interesting to see all the different directions this might go.<br><br>[<b>Daveed Benjamin</b>]: In answer to your question, <b>I would like to be able to look in any direction at any thing, whether I have a headset on or I’m using a phone or I’m looking online on a computer screen, </b>which may be antiquated in a while. <br>	I want to be able to see everything related to that particular thing that anyone ever thought was related to it. That was verified to be related to it, and not just pieces of text or pieces of videos, but also upcoming meetings and book clubs and conversations and ask me any things that are related to the thing that I’m looking at. <br>	And I want to also be able to generate using AI based on the thing where that thing that I’m looking at is the context for whatever I want to generate, and that should I should be also able to pull the best from that and share that. With that object so that when other people come by, they can actually see that and respond to it, or I don’t even have to use I, I should be able to, to attach a conversation to that object or a poll or a survey. And I really love the notion of being able to expand the information into the environment. And so if I did expand information into the environment, I should then be able to also to layer metadata on top of the the mural on the wall that I just put there. So, yeah, I think it would be could be pretty exciting and I want to be able to read comfortably and be able to be myself as a human when I want to as well. So to be easily in and out and easily deactivate upon needed or activated.<br><br>[<b>Frode Hegland</b>]: Yeah, it’s nice to hear those comments and wishes. And all I would like to say is two things to that and it’s pretty obvious but needs to be said. Number one, for that to happen, <b>you need to have the metadata. </b>Vint Cerf has been kind of egging us along for a while, saying, OK, we are, but there’s still so many problems to be filled in the normal flat-screen world. <br>	And a lot of it comes down to metadata. I mean, when I started working with Mark Anderson, doing our PhDs at Southampton, I thought I could do amazing visualisations coming from an arts background of citations and stuff until I found out the data wasn’t there. So the dreams you have, I agree. I applaud you. But just what I’m really wary of is that we start thinking like CD-ROM information ghettos, as I disparagingly call it, where everything works great as a demo, but the input output just isn’t there. So I’m very glad you highlighted that. And secondly, we’ve got experience in the book. Just this last week, I added a section of really simple experiments that even I did because Mozilla lets it be possible. There are the least fancy things in the world, but you can actually feel what it is to have the thing here or the thing there. So hopefully over the next year we can do more experiences because one thing that really surprised me was, yes, we want to be able to have connected lines in 3D, but doing even one line in a room that felt like a real room, it was like a washing line. It was really annoying. That was a shock. And that’s the kind of interesting thing we have to decide how to literally live with better. Peter.Ah, you dressed up too my man. I should have let you speak first.<br><br>[<b>Peter Wasilko</b>]: Thank you, Frode. <b>I think Doug would really want us to focus on fine grained addressability. </b>Being able to bookmark what it is that I’m seeing in the virtual space, what you’re seeing in the virtual space. Be able to compute what’s visible to both of us at a given moment so that I could see the isovist† representation of what elements in this 3D world Brandel you and I are looking at and. Maybe see, in addition to that, a request for what is it that Mark’s looking at that we’re not looking at? So the ability to capture my viewpoint versus your viewpoint and preserve that and also the state of the world as it’s being filtered by each of the participants, you might decide that you’re not interested in seeing any representations of data sources after 1970. So you could be seeing the exact same library setup that we are, only for you it would be less populated with materials because you’re only focused on those after a certain point of time. So we need to have a really rich view spec specification language.<br>[<b>Frode Hegland</b>]: If you cannot address it, you can’t address it. Addressability is just key. <br><br>[<b>Brandel Zarchernuk</b>]: First of all, thank you for pulling your focus into augmented and virtual reality and the way in which these mediations can impact what it is that reading is. I think it’s a really important and pressing subject for us to be able to think about how these whiz bang technologies, as Meta and other companies are releasing, can be put to use for what many would consider to be the most mundane applications of technology. But my <b>my belief is that the reason why we think of them as mundane is because they are the most fundamental,</b> the foundation upon which all other computing, all other information processing occurs. And so that’s why it’s vital, and that’s also why ultimately, I think it’s going to be absolutely the most structurally important and pivotal sort of development for human computer interaction and human perception and cognition. Once we have these rich environments, the thing that I want and I think this ties in nicely to what Doug would have wanted, is to be able to establish, like we have today, a dialogue, a back and forth process where we have the ability to manipulate and construct, elevate and alter the sort of representations of the information as we have it. I think that that’s going to be achieved. <br>	I have an Oculus Quest here, just the version 1. These have hand inputs. It wasn’t built as the sort of part of the initial design, but something that I discovered later on. And I’ve always thought that hands being so richly multi dimensional, 27 degrees of freedom each, have the opportunity to let us change things with such incredible nuance and specificity that if we can come up with basically a visual, expressive language for both the symbolic manipulation in terms of the way those symbols appear to us as well as that that manual manipulation in terms of what we what we actually do with our hands in order to do that, that we will have an absolutely transformative environment in which we can do what we would then understand as reading and what we would then understand as writing. A lot of people have become enamoured with things like ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence systems to do the rating for us or do the writing for us at this point. <br>	And I would sooner see us do all of that reading and writing ourselves, but reimagine what it is that reading writing is based on the benefits of the best that computing can offer us and the best way that we can express ourselves and and also view and interpret the expressions of others. So that’s a lot. But that’s that’s my story and I’m sticking to it. Thank you.<br>[<b>Frode Hegland</b>]: Yeah. And of course, as most of you know, Brandel is the reason, excuse, whatever you might call it we’ve been doing VR all year.<br><br>[<b>Richard Snyder</b>]: Yeah. Thank you so much. So just kind of following up on a couple of things from what Brandel said. I think it’s <b>interesting to to imagine harnessing the multi modality of the space,</b> the inherent multi modality of the space to a point where we’re perhaps using hands to organise text that we’re speaking into existence to the point where we’re speaking and there’s some sort of capture of what we’re saying and we’re moving those things around in real time as we’re speaking them and organising our thoughts. But I just keep coming back to the idea of organization. I would want, I’m sure you’re all aware of the communities surrounding Obsidian† and similar softwares that are using Markdown to organise thoughts. And there’s always this rhetoric of attempting to map the human brain into text using a highly customisable, highly personal, usable interface of text, organization and metadata. And I think I would want something that that looks outside of that rectangle for an organisational structure. I think that that’s a that’s a first place to look for how VR could benefit the future of text. And even going back to ChatGPT, I think you know keeping the thoughts ours, but allowing some similar software and machine learning to help us organise our thoughts or to do that in real time could be a really interesting collaboration with the machine. Thank you.<br>[<b>Frode Hegland</b>] Yeah. I mean, if we go further back, then. Doug, what have we got, man-computer symbiosis†, right?<br><br>[<b>Matthias Müller-Prove</b>]: Yeah, this just came to my mind. You just mentioned your experiment showing the links between two text pieces. This was actually. A workshop done a couple of years ago†. Totally different topic. But nonetheless.<br><center><img id="E8C2DB0F-6B4E-4539-A3D5-198B441BAA19" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/A1B396EF-B5FE-48AD-AC9A-745D6B40BDDB.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br>We were a group and had our findings spread out on the floor and someone came up with the idea. Let’s do the visual connections of what we are talking about. So this is real life and you get the idea and imagine what we’ve done there in VR in the near future. So mock up is one of the key things and play around and then see what’s feasible and what’s overwhelming us. I’m not really a fan of what was it Dave just said: “Show me everything. Show me everything related In the VR space of the future”. Yes, it should be visible, but don’t push it at me. It will be overwhelming to see all the information at once. So there must be a clever algorithm. I don’t really bet on AI/Artificial Intelligence, but there must be a clever augmenting algorithm which decides what might be of interest for me. And I should still feel in control of what’s going on. Hopefully I am in control. But give me more. Give me more. Dive into this direction. It’s more like scuba diving than showing everything at once and being on an LSD trip. So, so much for my first statement over here.<br><br>[<b>Frode Hegland</b>]: Yeah, that’s such an important point. I just wanted to show you here [shows Maps in Author].<br>https://youtu.be/GAsnBfZ8sWg?t=2444<br><br>This is our book and the map view and Author. It’s all over the place. It’s a real mess, which is kind of interesting. You say a mega screen a little wider than the visible screen, but let’s say I select Scott Rettberg. He has a line going to electronic literature in Norway, because if I do Command+D to see the definition, he is a person. That’s why it’s rendered italic and it has that text, as you can see in there. But along the lines of what you’re talking about, not showing everything, you’re absolutely right. That will be crucial. So the experiment we’re doing now, in addition to these fun things, which instantly become messy, is to be able to hide things.<br>	Wouldn’t it be interesting if these connections could go into this one and if there was a connection actually to, let’s say, Scott again, he would actually appear when it goes through there. So we have this kind of a concept of like a wormhole. Does that make sense? Because going through, you know, showing different sets. It’s one thing, but being able to somehow encapsulate and expand, encapsulate and expand would be interesting. Of course, in VR we have more opportunity, but just because we have more opportunity, it doesn’t mean we should use it. It could be a waste. We should still be circumspect about our space.<br><br>[<b>Daveed Banjamin</b>]: Obviously we wouldn’t show everything at once. What I was just saying is <b>that information needs to be available. </b>I believe that in the future we will have what I’m calling right now a smart filter. It will be adaptive, meaning that it tracks what you’re doing and adjusts. It will be tunable, meaning that you can manually tune it. It will be transparent so you can actually see what you’re not seeing. If you want to see what’s being tuned out, you, it’ll be portable, meaning you can take it to other places. And I’m also seeing the possibility of people being able to get paid for classifying information, objects, basically creating metadata, and that that metadata can feed into the filters. So that I could actually say, well, I don’t want to see highly obscene language or violence or whatever, and I can basically tune all these things. So yeah, I just wanted to make sure that you all knew that I didn’t think that, you know, a million things associated with my coffee pot should be all seen at once and it should be completely controllable.<br>[<b>Frode Hegland</b>]: The funny thing with VR, Daveed is that. You know, we agreed with everything you said. Obviously,<b> however, in a VR environment, it </b><b><i>can</i></b><b> be so much more data rich.</b> That’s one of the surprises. So if you encode the data intelligently, you can literally have a million times more than on a screen. So even though we’re great on both sides of what you said, the new opportunity is fascinating. <br><br>[<b>Karl Hebenstreit</b>]: I kind of have three things for for my vision. <br>	I’ve dedicated about half my career to <b>supporting people with disabilities. </b>So I see the greatest technical challenge of the next decade is can people with disabilities engage in in this virtual world, or are they going to be excluded? So in fact, it’s great. I work for the federal government and we actually have its diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility. And every agency had to submit an equity action plan and things. So we’ve got some tremendous thing there. <br>	The second thing then in that <b>could a disabled person be able to control a fully able avatar? </b>So can they be participating and people don’t have to know they have a disability. And the third part is — real quick. <br>	The third part then is sparked when I was reading <i>Thinking Fast and Slow</i>†, and can we have<b> interfaces that encourage slow thinking,</b> reflection and retrospection from an imagined future reality? What could be called a companion system to user interface? That’s not my dissertation. Somebody else could do that.<br>[<b>Frode Hegland</b>]: Yeah, you know this is just dog food for me. Just really briefly on, “slower discussions”–that’s why I’m very document focused. You write a document, share, it comes back. It’s not super fast. I think that is one of the ways to deal with that when it comes to disabilities. It’s really great the work that you’re doing. I think it’s also going to be interesting the discussion and learning over a while to find out how different attributes of a human are negatives and positives in these different environments, and also what kind of normality are we going towards? One of the things with Horizon Workrooms† where you sit there. This is Meta’s big flagship thing, very good avatars and all of that stuff. A lot of people, especially people with autism, do not want to be seen. You know, it’s intrusive. They want to sit there, maybe tap their fingers. There are lots of things they want to do. And when they’re on a zoom call or just audio, they can relax a little bit. So the question of what do we actually want to make possible is interesting in itself. So it’s really, really good to have you part of the conversation call.<br><br>[<b>Fabien Benetou</b>]: I need to share my screen. I have my little instruction that I can grab around with my hands and some of those instructions. Or could. So when they start with those G or prefix, it’s JavaScript and there was some shortcuts. So for example, load page range, it’s dedicated to the pages of a book. So if I pinch with my left hand at the beginning of it and I’m going to load the first 13 pages of the future of textbooks, which happens to be the table of content, those pages are a little bit too far me, but I’ll try.<br><br><center>https://youtu.be/GAsnBfZ8sWg?t=3017<br></center><br>[<b>Frode Hegland</b>]: I just want to highlight to everyone what you just did.<b> He just took a piece of code snippet floating in space, activated it to load what he wants it to do.</b> It’s just amazing. <br><br><center><img id="E91FC87C-E021-4090-B9DF-2E6EDCB413A7" src="./fot3-index-archive_files/B5B3AFE1-BC84-4D2D-9C4E-08A07121139E.jpeg"></center><center><br></center><br>[<b>Fabien Benetou</b>]: That’s the most that’s the key part, really, because I have a bunch of functions there, like loading the pages of the book. Each page of the book also loads some text, and that text also is code and that code is load the next page of the book so you can start exploring the whole book like this, grab the pages, move them around, you can type with those numbers, the page number and then start to load the next page and you have those little images on the back, which are the different features, some of them with the text and behind it the code so that you can activate those features. But again, the point is not really. Those features are just examples, the different functions. The point is if you type with those letters there which you have your Bluetooth keyboard, then you can interact with your environment as text, either just annotating. So for example, typing text on top of one of those pages or with code in order to modify either the environments or what’s around you or the content of the page, how you want to load the book. There was a discussion before about Obsidian. This one is not, but I’ll show you on my desktop with the same principle. So that’s on the web, so I can give you the link after. But if I load with this new resolution. Wow, this is tricky.This function get pages from Webdav is the same. It’s again the pages of the book, but they load it from a web directory. So meaning that you can instead of having a list of images, you have a directory. If you put a PDF or liquid file or JSON and they can also point toward this, you can load the content this way you don’t need like an API or something like this. So you can imagine directory or a set of files but available through the web and eventually write back. So whatever you wrote, how you organize the pages of the book can be written back to that directory shared again, but you have access to an actual file with it. And obviously you could move around it in my face now showing you that’s a little bit trickier. But I can show you like this with different features, like loading also containers like Docker containers. So they can have not just JavaScript executable, but any kind of code. And they’re really the novel part for that week had been the loading of the book. So that’s the actual book from the future of text three, not the latest version. I think it was from two days ago or three days ago. But then I can, I can switch to the latest version whenever it’s published and then you can start to grab and explore, exploit this point.<br>[<b>Frode Hegland</b>]: Fabien, could you please zoom in on a page just so we can see what a page looks like in VR just for the future records? I just want to highlight that as bad as it’s easy to think.<br>[<b>Fabien Benetou</b>]: So let me see if I can grab it. It’s absolutely worse through all those different uploading and compression and not on the on my screen. It is something else. It’s a funny sensation, by the way, because <b>those pages there are more or less in the location of my screen so it’s as if I was taking the pages from my physical screen.</b><br>[<b>Frode Hegland</b>]: Oh, my goodness. We have the best quote of the day right there. That’s really interesting.<br>[<b>Fabien Benetou</b>]: This is not a bug, this is to see a wireframe so that I can see there were some meshes or some part of the environment that are too demanding and I’m going to hide away. But it’s also a fun view for for that space or any space. So this way I can also show you the quality. I’m very close to it, but again, with it without a problem and then if I type. So do you see the augmented reality part on the on my screen? I try not to move too much. So if I pinch on those numbers. I can go back. I can also move the virtual keyboard wherever I want so I can type just those numbers. And then if I do enter, then that’s page 68 with the ability to go to the next page. So you can see. It’s never there. And if I execute that code there, here, I’m going to look. Page 69. Etcetera, etcetera. Again, it’s those functions and not the specific. I mean, it’s for this book in a linear format, but you can also think about graphic exploration, you know, whatever wiki or whatever, where you search for information and then go to the next node, open the nodes. Yeah, that’s up to you.<br>[<b>Frode Hegland</b>]: Yeah. Fantastic. We do have some more VR experiences we’ve done. Brandel has built a ton. They’re all in the book with links that are live for as long as they’re live, which is of course a general digital issue.<br><br>[<b>Dene Grigar</b>]: May I ask you a question? I was thinking as I wrote this into the chat, but preparing text, exporting text easily, or enrolled experience. We’re doing this with Uncle Buddy’s Phantom Funhouse†, trying to get everything 3D modelled. And it’s hard to get that text modelled in a way for experiencing even online in a desktop environment. So it’s going to be even more challenging to get it prepared for in-world in a VR environment. So what do you recommend? Because you’ve got I mean, literally you’ve got blocks of text, right? It’s not paper, it’s blocks.<b> So how will we be able to easily take a book, for example, and put it in world that is going to bypass all of that hard work we do in Maya and Blender and all the other technologies we use?</b><br>[<b>Fabien Benetou</b>]: One thing that I did not show. I don’t know how I could show it, but yeah, it depends what you want to do with that book. Like what are the affordances you expect here? What I showed were images converted from the PDF because it did the pages, let’s say a four letter. It makes it manipulable. Like you move there easily. It’s not, let’s say a single string of letters in. It could very well be, but I imagine that would not be necessarily very interesting. So it really depends on the affordance you want to have in there. The goal here was to have a little bit of both. So one thing I did not show was being able to pause that text and then see if there is code in it. And if you have code in it, then you load that code and you make it accessible, executable in that environment. But that’s not enough. Audience you would want depends on the kind of books you have. Also, maybe the book and 3D models or have. So it’s really up to the kind of content you want in terms of quality of text for rendering and all this. So I’m relying everything is on the web, I’m relying on a troika. And I started to tinker with fonts today. But as most people in the group know, I make things that barely work. They don’t actually look good. They don’t work the next day. So in terms of anything that has to be either efficient or beautiful or reliable, I probably I should not answer any of this kind of requirement works at all Troika with the three guys I had a have good result with. This works pretty well. So that’s what I use. I don’t know if I would recommend it, but that’s what I’m using.<br><br>[<b>Brandel Zarchernuk</b>]: So as well as being an enthusiast and a fan generally of text,<b> I’m also on the World Wide Web Consortium </b>Working Group for the Immersive Web. One of the reasons why I brought the concept of text to this group, which is the concept of virtual reality for this group, obviously they’re well-versed with text, is that we do have a standard, as Fabien is using called WebXR†, that’s where I met him. And it’s a system where web browsers, Chrome, Firefox, those kinds of things have the ability to create a virtual reality environment based on what what stuff you send them. Web browsers are what we see most of the internet on, and much of our computing is done through browsers, either directly or indirectly through apps these days. So apps like Twitter and Facebook are web browsers as well as the Chrome and Safari that folks use on their on their devices as well. So the good news is that that the thing that we use to consume most of our text is the thing that also does virtual reality will have the ability to do virtual reality in the future. The bad news is that the two don’t really touch each other in terms of the presentation of virtual reality content. As you sort of noted, a lot of people are having to build those things in my app land or that kind of thing. My hope, both in terms of my aspirations for the future, but also my professional goal is to make sure that immersive web or web WebEx are has the ability to consume text directly, has the ability for people to be able to make web pages that have the ability to very quickly become sort of spatial and 3D. I’ve done a couple of experiments. They’re the ones listed in the book that actually have the ability to lift Wikipedia pages directly without any conversion on any other applications to be able to then view those not just as a page within a headset. That’s possible through the generic two-dimensional browser within virtual reality headsets like the (Oculus) Quest. But to convert those things into objects that have the ability to be intrinsically three dimensional, there are a couple of sort of underpinning technologies that I have to use myself. It’s my hope that we can we can come up with standards that should mean that within the next few years, ideally people have the ability to basically use the HTML and CSS languages that people have been using for the last 20 something years to produce text to do so in a way that will then allow them to do that spatially, intrinsically, in three dimensions. That future is not here yet, but it’s my goal. And for anybody who wants to sort of jump the queue, leap ahead, then the technologies that are being mentioned. Troika† is a something called a science distance field text font generator, and it’s doing something very similar to what I built for the Wikipedia system. There are systems out there. It is necessary to handle them. It is preferable to use something that is explicitly for text rather than to use something like Maya or Blender for constructing those things. But if you’re if you’re interested in trying to get to it early before the standards are worked out, then’d be happy to help.<br><br>[<b>Frode Hegland</b>]: Big points there. First of all, I think that very, <b>very soon it will be VR first,</b> I think that our offices will be VR are 100% very, very soon. And we will just, just in the same way that I can do a lot on my tiny little watch, we will think of the laptop screen in a similar way. We will still we will use laptops for the next hundred years. I’m sure it has a very specific thing about it, but it also comes down to what we mean by space, because a VR room is not one thing. And I think that’s really something we’ve started to feel over the year. And what I mean by that is the most useful work that I get done so far is the background is literally just whatever I’m in. It can be a fake room or it can be passed through or whatever it is that my work objects, they don’t really relate to the room. Just like if you open up a book and look at the layout of a printed book, no one’s going to say, How does that relate to the wall behind you? Right. And I know that is, of course, obvious, but I’m saying it because once you’re in a fully digital environment, it kind of does in a way.So we have to make decisions on what space is where referring to. So there will absolutely be interesting things that happened over the year, at least as that that new for me that I’ve noticed is plane detection so that the system knows what a thing is more and more. So that means that, for instance, you can define the wall in front of you at home or in your case, maybe the wall behind you there. That is your virtual and physical bookcase. So when you open up, let’s say one of our magical books and of course it won’t all be about magical books, but for the sake of argument, you have a magical book. It opens up all the references now populate what you have said as a shelf. So the reason I’m giving these examples is I don’t think we’re every in every instance going to need to do {x,y} coordinates for every single thing. I think there will be relative to the things what they are. So if you have said that another wall is for photographs from a book, you splay them up on the wall, you do a layout. That layout will be for that wall. So if you now go to a coffee shop or an office or somewhere else, if you don’t have that kind of assigned space, I can imagine almost an animation of those pictures flattering about saying, What the hell are we supposed to go? So it won’t be a one-off space. And I think this is an example of what we have to experience in order to get to the next step of what to do. And in the beginning of our Future Text Lab, it was really jumping in and doing everything completely different. And now we’re almost back to reading a plain book in VR. I mean, Adam Wern was not here today: he comes in and out, genius, Swedish guy. He has some ideas for reading that are really off the wall. You know, we need to support that. But more than anything, I think we need to build. Build and try and build and try. And next year, before I give the mic over to Fabien, so to speak. Can we at least try to have this meeting even if next year isn’t all about VR? Can we try to have this meeting with headsets on? Even if we don’t necessarily see each other, that sound could be Zoom, but we can look at our knowledge objects together.<br><br>[<b>Fabien Benetou</b>]: I’m going to also allow me to briefly share my screen back, but just to show the five different kind of text I used. <br>	The the first, let’s say, type of text that I’m using or I’ll shoot here, the code is like this, a text, and then it has a value, let’s say container. So that that looks like HTML-ish, so it’s not a 3D model. It’s easy to understand. Inspect, modify. If I change this, my title is going to look like a dated or read rather like protocol. So that’s one way that it was also the submit thing during the event and I put a bit of sound there. But yeah, you have the data there. So that’s as, let’s say direct as this same also if I type on the screen here, you saw the through all the eyes and there were no there grab or manipulable in here. <br>	Another way is images so like the feature of the symposium and then I converted a poster to a kanji, but there is text in it another way. 	But as Brandel wanted, it’s still experimental layers where they were kind of augmented reality, kind of shortcuts to show high quality, but not in 3D, let’s say anymore. Not really in space anymore. <br>	And finally, on the last point about wikis and Wikipedia and whatnot is uploading from another source, like I said, with web dev. So that’s directly from my wiki. So that’s the wiki page. Not necessarily the beautiful one, but but I can still edit it like so and it’s going to change it here. Being usable, parseable as JSON and then it can be loaded in the environment. <br>	The point is none of them are as a source, a 3D model,<b> they become 3D model at different stages in different ways. </b><br>	But that’s again, depending on what affordances you would want here, it’s code. So for example, I would expect to have syntax highlighting here with text. So I would not, but I would eventually expect other like bolding or so it’s entirely depending on the use for it. And that being exploratory, like, I don’t really know also myself, how is it just going to be short code snippet like this or grouping them and becoming gigantic? So there are myriad of ways to do it, but it’s I would argue it’s still as is, even though it’s experimental today, it’s still quite usable. That being said, once I have organise my stuff, I’m also reading on this on a remarkable or on printed paper. That’s also why I mentioned saving back to the wiki through WebDAV. Those are intermediary steps. It’s not necessarily the end goal is not to stay stuck in the in the headset. It’s like getting there to to to do more. Not that Yeah. Stay in there and.<br>[<b>Frode Hegland</b>]: That was really great. I just wanted to add that if it’s readable by the environment, you know, in a consistent manner, it’s good, right? Which is why HTML has been useful for for you.<br><br>[<b>Mark Anderson</b>]: I’m glad I waited because in fact, it’s really good to say what I’m about to say, actually, having seen Fabien’s demo, because as ever, I really enjoyed it. And another part of me was thinking, I mean, not perhaps this room of people, but for most people it is both fascinating and sort of beyond their comprehension to make. And what prompted me to put my hand up earlier was was question Brandel had asked me the other day. It’s about an app on or for, Oculus, which I won’t name because the point is not it’s not about that, that app per se. But the thing was, well, <b>can can it organise things in the space? </b>And I was asking on their Discord channel and I was immediately struck by how quickly it went to somebody saying, “Right, so you want to do a complex SQL query?”And I’m thinking, “No, I just want the red things and the blue things to be movable apart”—really simple affordances, partly because my most of my work is knowledge exploration. I very much want to work in uncluttered spaces, and I don’t want AI or Machine Learning or something to trample all over the very gentle exploratory work I’m doing. Because what you’re trying to do is to surface information and patterns, and the moment you just say, “Well, you know, everything where X is more than 3 needs to go over there” is absolutely what you don’t need. It’s more about saying these things are not those things: these should be close, those should be far away. Very, very simple affordances. And what I found really interesting in the discussion, everyone was saying two things. One is that they all wanted to do something far more complicated and hard-edged. And the other was, “Of course, what you really need to do is” followed by the word “just…” basically build it all yourself and then bring it in and thinking, I don’t think you really understand. And perhaps that’s unfair because, juxtaposed to what Fabien just showed us, that’s a lot of hard work and that’s doing stuff that in a way is state of the art. And what I’m talking about clearly is, in a sense, a generation in sort of development terms behind that, because the point where the sort of affordances he’s showing and doing things like this to be able to get at things in the space and the manipulation that Brandel’s talking about aren’t quite there for someone who isn’t basically coding it themselves. <br><b>	But to me that’s the lure of VR, a massive screen doing on screen what otherwise you have to do in here. </b><br>	Because closest I get to at the moment is working on infinite maps and tools like Tinderbox†, a sort of textural text analysis tool, but it’s two dimensional and sometimes you need more space, not because you need another physical dimension, but you just need more space. And the other thing is, normally most of us are working within the physical confines of a screen. So it is either too small to read to see everything there or it’s big enough to read and you can’t see the whole picture. And the wonderful provocation of a VR space is, well, you can have all that. Because we do that in our mind’s eye quite naturally. And so the affordances that we need to begin to develop are the ability to collapse and expand things to move. Whether the data moves that we move is another interesting thing. Maybe I want to teleport because I actually want to stand on the other side of my little universe of information. So I’m sitting on my enthusiasm for the moment because I know the things that I really want to do are some way off. But that’s what I find so really interesting to see in the work Brandel’s done and Fabien has done, because I can see hinted in that the things that I’m talking about and I’m extremely conscious that it’s a while off because although I talk about metadata, my relationship to metadata is less of someone producing data structures. I mean, I’m more like (Harry) Tuttle† and basically been an information emergency plumber for many years. So it’s actually the realisation that if you didn’t put a bit of information on it, you may not be able to find it. So that’s in a sense where I come to metadata from and that this, again, is pertinent because as Frode said at outset in order to have these things in order to be constructed, they all have to have enough information to even build the structures. <br>	And I’ll just jump onto one side point before hand back to the room. And that is I was thinking when Frode was speaking just now about different rooms, another way I think of those is different view specs because in a sense it may be the same information underlying it, say for sake of argument, the book, but in one, in one room, one view, I may be looking at a subsection of the book, or I might be looking in another room, I might be looking at another strand through the book that I’ve somehow extracted and visualised and in moving between the rooms we’re just getting back to Doug’s view specs. I know it’s a term that sadly has not survived, which is a shame because I don’t think — I may be wrong, so this is sort of room where someone probably correct me that it’s alive and living or it’s called something else. And if so that’s great and I wish it were the case, but this idea of having multiple views on the same underlying data is something that oddly, not necessarily for those here, but many I think, have lost sight of in the years since the early sort of hypertext work. Anyway, I leave those thoughts for what they are. Right.<br><br>[<b>Fabien Benetou</b>]: Yeah, two quick things in terms of the apparent complexity of it or the difficulty to understand. That’s mostly me <b>being unable to present properly because I’m still discovering the thing.</b> So as I present, I’m like, Well, how do I show it? What do I show? What does this mean? What is it open? One One thing I shared recently with Brandel and few others is I gave a workshop to kids last Saturday for 20 kids, about 10 to 11 years old, and they got it. So that that was I mean, they had a good time. What did they actually understand is something else? But the point is, did you have a good time? And they were able to manipulate. They were able to execute code. They’re not the coder, but they were able to see text that once interacted with in a specific way was either moved and that was just like moving it around or then does something. And they had quite a bit of and again, it doesn’t mean they understood what it meant or what it opens up. But yeah, some kids at least both had fun and were able to interact with this kind of environment and with like in 25 minutes or less, not like a long introduction or anything of the sort. It was pretty much like you put the headset on and try to pinch ledgers or move things around. So in terms of discovering one boarding or being able to play with the thing, it’s not necessarily that complicated. It should be much easier. <br>	I have another workshop on Saturday, again, not tomorrow, but next week. Of course, if you have ideas suggestion, please let me know. One One interesting discovery or realisation was that initially they said, Oh, I wanted a roller coaster with a murdering cloud and this kind of stuff. I thought they would like dinosaurs and exciting things, and I just gave them text. I just give them whatever you saw. And even in a boring, let’s say, library from the Sixties room. And that was enough because they had some agency, they had a sense of doing something and discovering something new and nobody usually grab text in mid-air and it’s there and it does something. So that was that. There was no need for something. I don’t want to say childish, but then I would have projected that kids would have wanted instead. So that was that was the pretty positive aspect.<br><br>[<b>Brandel Zarchernuk</b>]: Based on some of the characterisations that people have made about the spaces and having more space. <b>I feel like it’s really valuable for us to take stock of and reappraise the kind of information spaces that we reside in ourselves right now </b>in order to be able to think about what those opportunities are. So right now we all are by definition on computers talking to each other. Those are incredible things that have very high colour depth, very high refresh rate, 60-120 hertz. But they also take up unless you’re really staring right up into the into the screen, a relatively small angular field of view. You can get more pixels, but rarely do you move beyond, say, I think this thing is probably taking up 20 degrees of field of view. <br>	I have information elsewhere. It’s not in the photo here, but I have a picture of my my wife’s ‘Inktober’†. It’s a poster. I look, I’ve got a bunch of books on my on my desktop, although there’s a lot of other junk as well. So I have Bob Horn’s <i>Mapping Hypertext</i>† book and Lewis Mumford’s <i>Technics and Civilization</i>.†.<b> These are these are also pieces of information that are also displays of information. </b><br>	They are much cheaper comparatively than my Mac book in terms of their their ability to be reproduced. I could buy more in a way that I probably won’t buy another Mac book, but they have incredibly low latency, high latency. In terms of the refresh rate, this doesn’t refresh, but we don’t think of them as doing the same job necessarily as as the computer screens. Another really important thing about this is that it is manipulable enough and cheap enough for me to not consider what I’m doing with it, not consider the fact that I’m able to actually move it up to my face and move it around in a way that, again, I will not do with my MacBook for the most part. I pull it up to my face and really stare at it. <br>	There are some technical reasons why that’s not going to be practical to do in virtual reality for the foreseeable future, to do with something called the ‘vergence-accommodation conflict’†. We basically need to invent a new category of optics in order to be able to do that, and thankfully Meta is pouring money into it. Another thing that we we sometimes do but don’t always is that we can manipulate books and other more destructive and and creative ways. So this was a this is a thick book. So I actually cut it in half so that I could deal with the halves in reasonable enough order and be able to sleep and read in bed without risk of breaking my nose with it. But the the important thing to do within the context of understanding what reading and virtual reality is and will be is to realise that there are benefits. Oh, the other thing about about what happens on your computer screen is that because it’s currently emulating a two-dimensional surface, it’s less off the wall to realise that none of it is obeying the laws of physics. You don’t have to worry about sticking things on. You don’t have to worry about the relative weight of those things. Once you get into virtual reality and you have the ability to put a sticky note here in space or here, there are some psychological reasons why it’s not necessarily the best idea to do that all the time, but it’s possible to be able to position those things in free space. <br><b>	Computers more generally do not need to obey the laws of physics.</b> You don’t need to have the those objects be stuck up in the same way that my my Inktober poster is stuck on the wall. <br><b>	So there are phenomenal opportunities and advantages.</b> Likewise with Mumford or with Hypertext. I don’t have the ability to actually change the size of it in the way that I do on a computer screen or in a sort of natively digital environment. I have the ability to take it to a coffee shop and use a digital intermediary to then re-render effectively remember, the refresh rate concept, the artefact at a higher sort of scale. And in fact in some environments people actually do that in order to be able to have it sort of reimagined and reframed as an object of significance. But all of those things are trivially and literally at our fingertips when we have a digital environment. And I think it’s an important thing to invite everybody into imagining it. When you have the ability to do reading for your own benefit, manipulating these spaces, environments, texts in that level, with that level of fluency, what does it look like? What do you do? And I think that’s something that we all need to play with for the next while.<br><br>[<b>Frode Hegland</b>]: <b>How would you want to read and interact with FoT4 the Future of Text book 4 next year?</b> You know, are we going to do nothing or are we going to overthink and pretend we’re 50 years in the future? Or are we going to think of what realistically can be done with now, but that we would actually find beneficial.<br><br>[<b>Matthias Müller-Prove</b>]: Thank you for using the word interaction. How do we want to interact with the book? I suspect that we are all of us, that the economy as such, the technical economy as such, is blown away by the hype of virtual reality, which is a sphere, it’s a dome, it’s high pixels, it’s almost 3D games and lots of fun. <b>But we tend to forget the interaction.</b> And that’s how to point at something, how to select something, how to say from here to there to capture something, to put something from here to there, to use gestures, to shrug with shoulders, to raise an eyebrow. So all this stuff is kind of neglected or not on the focus of research right now. So what I like to see between now and the real bright future is that interaction schemes and patterns are being developed, tested and developed, and that we get to a kind of consistency how to interact with these little spaces on text. And right now it’s every vendor who invents something new and you have a steep learning curve and you’re enthused because now you can operate with goggles and handles, but you’re totally lost. Once you move from one system to the other.So I’m urging for a kind of valid, sound, robust, reliable, consistent interaction paradigms for what’s coming in the future. Not to leave it to the nerds and engineers.<br>[<b>Frode Hegland</b>]: I am not sure if I agree with you right there because that’s going to happen next year. To a large degree, you know, Apple, they always do it. They come out with some interaction that people like, very limiting, but it gets most done. So, yes, now we’re living through a Cambrian explosion. Let’s have it a little bit longer because of course, you are right, no question. But we have to make sure that we’ve had enough experimentation of interactions to get to that point. And again, you are right, because it’s also putting people off. We’ve got to do what you’re saying. I’m just wary of doing it too quickly with too many systems. Let’s be a bit more crazy for a while maybe.<br>[<b>Fabien Benetou</b>]: So for me, that’s shocking to hear this because <b>I focus just on interactions.</b> So that’s definitely the most interesting aspect. It’s not like having a screen or even a volume is how you’re going to interact with it, with the content in it, with your content outside of it. So I’m convinced, like you build your reality, even forgetting the headset through interactions you interact with the world, it pushes back. And that’s how you build an understanding of reality and virtual reality. So I’m pretty convinced that the interaction at the centre of it. And for this one, how I would want to read the next version is we had an example through the last discussion is because each of us does read differently in and out of VR that each of us would share at least one ideally code snippet or specifications of a tool that is precious to them. And if I say code snippet because ideally the book itself would be a set of tools on reading better. If that’s in VR, why not? It doesn’t have to be. We discussed this last time about having a ruler or bookmark or whatever and being able to define a small function that supports reading and then we can exchange with each other. So we have a little small collection, not of content, but of documented content, like as the different tools that have, let’s say, Post-it notes or pens or whatnot. These kind of things would be not just the content of the book, but the tool within the book to better read that book. And in an inclusive, intellectually speaking fashion, in the sense that that’s, let’s say I would share my way with a small tool and how I read doesn’t have to be useful to anybody else, but hopefully it might. And same way, it’s not a formative way, but a proposal.<br><br>[<b>Peter Wasilko</b>]: <b>I hope we’ll have mixed mode control </b>so that I could raise my hands like this and say. Open the Future of Text Volume 3 and then have the system recognise my voice and raise the book into the position of my hands and then be able to move it up off to the side. Let go of that book raise another book again, using hand gestures, put the two books next to each other, but the mixture of hand gestures and spoken dialogue to drive the interactions. So I could say, you know, “jump to Fabien’s section” and then in the physical copy, well, in the virtual copy of the book, the book would just automatically advance to the start the Fabien section in the text. So again, a mix of a domain specific language for operating the model and hand gestures to indicate where within the spatial area I want the activity to occur. So I’m sort of assuming that our future headset in five or seven years is going to, in addition to having a full tracking of gestures and recognition of positions of objects, the ability to have a simple API to be able to get the text that’s being spoken in its presence and then feed that off to arbitrary code. So it won’t necessarily be Apple’s code running the parser, but rather I can write my own parts and just simply grab what’s currently been said off of a simple API.<br><br>[<b>Frode Hegland</b>]: But this kind of stuff–please start shaking your head if you violently agree guys–can be done literally today and the only thing stopping us is money and imagination, right? Because some of those are big things. But really, you know, what we are doing now is trying to get a transcript where we are a lot less people than expected. And that’s absolutely fine. It’s a better dialogue. But if there’s something after this, you think about over the weekend that you want to have written into the book, you know,<b> I’m just desperately worried about–sorry, Matthias–too quick homogeneity in VR</b>. You know, Mark Anderson refers to too quick formalisation. You know, we just don’t damn know. Like Brandel talks about hands, hands, hands all the time. Great. Most of the time it is a real revelation in VR, but sometimes you need a device, right? So it’s so easy to get excited over something and Brandel knows so much about VR. We just have to have the opportunity for people to just try different shit. But so what you just said, Peter, if you want to write it as a piece, I’ll put it in the one sentence thoughts section we have in the book. And Richard, please, obviously feel free to do the same if you want to. And Matthias if you want to argue with us. I mean, like Fabien and me, we’re literally fighting the book as it’s written horrible incentive, vile stuff against the case, against books and things like that, you know? So I have to hold my, my own. But anyway, yeah, what’s this? Onboarding demos and so on.<br>[<b>Matthias Müller-Prove</b>]: Point taken. And acknowledged. Maybe from a different angle. What I like to see and remind all of us. We are designing for humans and humans have certain abilities. If we go 360 degrees in a circle and have an infinite space, this is probably overwhelming because no one is used to this space already. Yes, we can go crazy. We can go Matrix, we can go Hollywood 3.0 or whatever. <b>But we still design for human beings. And if we want to augment what humans are, then we don’t have to forget what what’s in the centre of this new sphere. </b>That’s my another twist to my point. The other one totally agreed. Standards too early is limiting us. That’s not my point.<br>[<b>Frode Hegland</b>]: You said something really beautiful there. You said the human is at the centre of this sphere. It captures that literally and philosophically and morality wise and lots of things. So I think one thing that in this group, what I’ve seen doing is flailing around the whole sphere, coming to that realisation and then being overly being focused on the knowledge object in front of us. At least I have been. It’s like, okay, forget about the background. It’s too many damn pixels. <br>	What shape can we make our knowledge here?<br>	I think you’re completely right. <br>	I hope will happen over time is that our brains will develop into the entire sphere, but that will take years. Because that will be literally growing up in an environment that isn’t like anything. You know, like today we have digital natives and all of that nonsense. I mean, I remember starting with Liquid and stuff, being a relatively old guy and a lot of people saying, what is this? What is that? Not caring about digital. And then suddenly Facebook people tag pictures like, do you realise you are uploading to the Internet and adding metadata to share your knowledge in a community? Do you? So that’s why I’m saying the term VR won’t survive for people doing this. They’re not going to care what we call it. It’ll be their headset and I can do a this and a that. It’s our responsibility as people who care, to try to figure out what the this and the that is.<br><br>[<b>Fabien Benetou</b>]: Then also about, let’s say, getting used to this fear or how will we organise it. I, said before, but I’ll say it again, like I showed the <b>demo without any even expectation of usefulness,</b> but some kind of grounding to say it exists rather than just quote unquote, having philosophical discussion. And also because from an egoistic perspective,<b> I don’t think waiting for the medium to be good is interesting.</b> It’s like playing with it right now, even if it you see the boundaries, that’s valuable, Even if I literally throw away all the headset that I have in the trash and all the code I’ve written, I absolutely don’t mind because<b> I think that’s by exploring through that sphere or environment or whatever actual shape it has, </b>that’s the actually interesting point. And also because if I don’t, then again, and as Frode repeated also often it means relying on somebodies own exploration and their conclusion of it, which might be very good for them, but completely awful for me. So<b> the way we’re going to evolve through that sphere, whatever shape it has or that volume, that’s the most interesting part. And it cannot be delegated. It cannot be weighted.</b> And yes, it’s very frustrating because the hardware and the software has limits, but it always will be. So there is literally no point in waiting for better hardware. It will come. But then what are you going to learn in between? And again, if the hardware doesn’t come tomorrow, all the new ideas it provided or help me think and see through the will, that also was the valuable part. Every new is literally no view or tomorrow. I’m perfectly fine with that.<br>[<b>Frode Hegland</b>]: Yes. And thank you for being for being one of the biggest contributors for the book on all kinds of opinions. You know, that will be what people can break through. So thanks for that. <br><br>[<b>Mark Anderson</b>]: So how would I like to look at the next book, given that the next book is arguably the sum of all four volumes and we haven’t written the next bit. One of the things I really want to be able to do is for the book to just be simply a physically-based view spec on, well, I’ve not got a word for what it is, but in other words, l<b>et’s move beyond the book</b> because to a certain extent that’s one of the things I’ll explain. <br>	Now that doesn’t mean that we may not choose that one of the ways we might not, for instance, want to read the content of the book is as manifested in the form of a visual page because that’s culturally and sort of educationally something we’re used to. But I think that’s something we ran into at the end of this year, because quite late on towards finishing up for the book, we started having discussions about, well, how we might extract elements from it. And one of the issues we faced actually is it transpires we don’t have the metadata. So you have kindly shown in the present book right at the end, something, you learned an Author in terms of some automatic extraction of entities and things from it. But it does show up the limitations. For instance, there’s something to show up automatically, it literally normally has to appear as a text term because software isn’t that clever and understanding the semantics of our speech and writing. So that says to me, maybe we need to do some retrospective work in terms of actually looking at some of the stranding of stuff we’ve got at the moment. And I mention that because I think that may help inform us of what we’re missing in terms of again, and I don’t want to prematurely formalise it, but in a sense of the metadata structures. <br>	So to do what we want, what do we not have? It’s not enough to imagine it at this point to move to the next step. I think we need to say “Right we need to have this strand of information, in order to display things along this axis”, we need to actually know what that axis is and we need to be able to place things along it. So I think that’s something for us to aspire to for next year.<br>[<b>Frode Hegland</b>]: Yeah, that’s great Mark. But you know, when it comes to the actual book, here is Volume One. There’s Volume Two, they both have visual meta, but the second one has its done automatically. And all the web servers in the world can go down. I’ll still have it.<br>[<b>Mark Anderson</b>]: I think we’re talking at cross purposes. Now, I have to agree with what you say. I mean, I am surrounded by a room full of books. I’m the last person who’s going to say I won’t consume it in this form. But what I really meant was, I just want to see all the things on typography or I just want the stranding that we talk about quite often. But<b> I’m well aware that the distance between the imagination and actually manifesting it even with the code, </b>there is another part that that hasn’t been done and we did hit this at the end of this year. I mean, it’s nobody’s fault, but it’s taking that realisation and running with it because having that extra information enables us to have additional and newly interesting view specs on the information that is the whole of the corpus of the books.<br>[<b>Frode Hegland</b>]: I’m going to arrest this a little bit because we’ve kind of been going in the community on this quite a lot because I agree with the desire, no question. But like, for instance, here are these peoples. And when I defined them, if they hadn’t said if they are an academic or an author an artist, I don’t actually feel comfortable labelling them. And I’m saying that it’s the most basic one. All right? So in order to get metadata, you have to have someone who is an authority to a degree or just have an opinion as fine. And this is why we talked about the whole idea of having like a book deejay or curator or whatever it might be. But a lot of this stuff about who people are, I mean, even trying to do a timeline, just even to get people’s birthdays or birth years has been a challenge because a lot of people you don’t want to embarrass. There’s a lot of people who just don’t give a monkey’s. And then there are other people diving into the book and driving me quite literally insane weather or miniature changes they want from their bibliography. So I agree with the sentiment, but we can’t do anything with that metadata if we can’t get that metadata. And<b> it’s such an intensely human problem.</b><br>[<b>Mark Anderson</b>]: But I wouldn’t start with the people because even just for instance, from the privacy thing, but subject matter is less is less problematic in that regard. David Lebow did certainly did some analysis on Volume One that we haven’t circled back around to. And I think that might give some potentially low-hanging fruit. Well, and to break out this problem about not wanting to make a judgment on things.<br>[<b>Frode Hegland</b>]: Right. But this is why the<b> notion we’ve talked about a lot of different bindings, </b>you know, like I want to be able to say maybe Mark Anderson’s version of the book where he has chosen to define this or that or whatever, and then go to that stream. Right? That’s a kind of circling back on that.<br><br>[<b>Brandel Zarchernuk</b>]: I wanted to talk about the sort of characterisation of this moment as the <b>Cambrian Explosion.</b> And one of the things to drag the metaphor along is that the Cambrian Explosion was 500 million years ago. <br>	A lot of cool stuff happened, arguably, but it was still another 200 million years until the first mammal appeared. <br>	And it could be claimed that mammals are pretty important to the current sort of context. <br>	And I would characterise the current moment and virtual reality as Cambrian in that sense, not only from its profusion of stuff, but also because of its size or lack of even the first instance, iteration, what have you. So what might be useful for us for informational purposes? As I said, I’ve been involved or I’ve been said I’ve been involved in virtual reality for a while now and in web virtual reality. And I met in 2016 talking about this stuff and the sort of the standards bodies, committees, people interested in this have been working on it for many years now, but without nearly enough emphasis, nearly enough interest in information and processing and text. And so we don’t. So while some of the first computer displays were actually augmented reality displays, Sword of Damocles was an AR display for tech, for the state of understanding what the benefits are for information are incredibly sparse on the ground. And one of my reasons for trying to bring virtual reality to a group of people and an audience like this is to say it’s critical that we seriously think about what our needs are within information processing, within text and reading, in order to make sure that that the very first mammalian species occurs like emerges within this Cambrian explosion. <br>	To skip forward those 200 million years in order to say we have to see it. We have to see what what happens here when we take the needs and the opportunities of text and reading and writing seriously enough to include them. Because everybody has been looking at video games, they’ve been looking at immersive video, all of these things which are either gee whiz or containing really utility, but don’t have the opportunity for real rich creation and expression and and mutual sense making. Ah, certainly VR chat and other systems are places where people have made a phenomenal amount of meaning for each other within, but it’s been utterly ephemeral and it hasn’t had a number of the characteristics that we would typically require of text in order to make sure that it passes those thresholds of, of value and importance, legibility, search ability, those kinds of things. So yeah, we are earlier than you probably think in terms of the function of of text within within this place. And, and it’s important to realise just how early that can be. <br>	There’s a really wonderful video from the Computer History Museum of Larry Tesler who sadly passed away this year. He was one of the original Macintosh people. He was actually at Xerox PARC as well. And he talks about the fact that once upon a time <b>they didn’t know what a scrollbar was. They called it an ‘elevator’. </b>They thought that maybe they would have a whole bunch of sort of spiky briccolage stuff around the outside of a window in order to identify the reasonable places by which you could resize it. Ultimately, people decided that you actually need to be able to grab it and drag it from anywhere. <br>	So those concepts as bedrock as they are now in a two-dimensional context were incredibly difficult to work with and incredibly difficult to kind of make sense of. And if you look back even into thee, would say the scrollbar has really settled down in the early nineties, but prior to that they were all over the place. Up arrows, down arrows, <b>we don’t have even the basic sort of grounding of what a scroll bar or its equivalent is within virtual reality right now. </b><br>	And <b>it behooves us as people who care about and know about text, to think about what, what kinds of motifs and themes are necessary for us to be able to pursue in order to do that.</b><br><br>[<b>Frode Hegland</b>]: And my trusty assistant [his wife Emily], just at the right moment hands me this book, <i>The Rise and Reign of the Mammals</i> <a href="http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=CHtZEAAAQBAJ&amp;hl=&amp;source=gbs_api">(Brusatte, 2022)</a>. Which is just quite amusing, considering what you were talking about. It’s really fascinating. So the first mammal, it’s just to be very literal, we’re a little they were tiny little mousey creatures, obviously, right. None of them flew jet planes. <br>	And I’m saying that because in my little massively long speech in the beginning, I say that the first thing,<b> if I was running Apple or Google or Meta or any of these VR companies, the first thing I would do is get a team to make it so that if you have a laptop open in front of you, put your headset on, you will see your damn screen. It is so mundane,</b> but I really think that would open the market amazingly much. <br>	And if you had the next step to be able to pull on the top of the screen to make it bigger and this way or that way, wow, you’ve changed what computing is. Boom, Right? I honestly believe that. <br>	Now, the reason I’m saying it is Brandel you need to work in VR too.<br>	Not all the time, but you need to be there. <br>	I don’t work there very often, but I try to use this guy [holds Quest Pro] and I use just Author. I just use a bigger monitor. What I do, I fake it. I make the author screen massive, make the text tiny, make a small column because I can’t make a fake virtual screen. And I know obviously Brandel we’ve discussed this in software.<b> I should be able to make a virtual screen, but I can’t. </b>It has to be something to make things as an actual screen. <br>	That’s the current limitation, that there is so much that this little mammal can do with the little stuff that we have now, which can be literally useful if we as a community pull a few pieces together. Like if I can easily go in and out of Fabien’s environment and things, we just have to start there. <b>We just have to make it useful. </b>You know, and then we can have a couple of million years of evolution happen in a few months, don’t forget. You know, think like GPT three. There’s a new article in our book today, which is by <a href="http://futuretextpublishing.com/download/fot3-index.html#6E8E638C-79C8-45A7-9ECB-EC57C66FDF17">Chris Gutteridge.</a> He got a  Shakespearean sonnet about Doug Engelbart in there that it generated this morning so what’s happening with AI is so insanely rapid. <br>	There is the discussion of <b>Doug Engelbart being at the MIT campus and talking to Marvin Minsky </b>and Marvin Minsky saying, ‘you know, we’re going to make computer smart, we’re going to be able to make them reason and think’. And Doug said, ‘that’s great. What are you going to do for people?’ Doug told me that particular discussion didn’t happen, but the sentiment is entirely correct. We are, as we’ve all agreed, as the potential to help us think. And if we now just let the AI thing just take off, which it will, without us actually doing a few useful things, we’re so screwed. <br>	You know, I use my headset so much less than I should. So this is not coming from any kind of a high horse. This is coming from a horse of saying, you know, can we get a saddle together? Everyone? <b>Can we do a few ordinary things? </b>And what I hope Brandel, especially with your amazing advanced work that is so interactive and so deep, that when we do the really basic, mundane stuff, some of it Adam has done and he’s not here and when I say, you know, if we can combine that stuff and this stuff, it’ll be amazing because very often in discussions it floats around somewhere. I would like it if this community could define and build, not necessarily build, but <b>define the specification of a reading tool and a word processor in VR,</b> it’s not that obvious. <br><br>[<b>Frode Hegland</b>]: In our last few minutes here, considering we do have to publish the book at some point, considering the year will end at some point, and considering that I desperately want people to be able to cite this year for their ideas and not next year because of things. (I’m looking at Matthias’ comment there.) What are the things that we really want to write down in the sand for the future? Let’s say that someone in literally 54 years–considering it’s 54 years since Doug’s demo more today–another 54 years when we’re all either dead or too old to answer the phone if there is a phone.<b> What do we want them to have from this chat today?</b> <br>	So what did we dream VR could do for us? Maybe we should look at it that way. What’s the effect we want it to have on us? Come on, guys. And unfortunately, after Dene left, we are all guys. But that’s another thing to work on.<br><br>[<b>Mark Anderson</b>]: One thought to me is is effectively to free text from the page. And this speaks to moving beyond our last generation of technology, because we often talk about text as basic, basically being a symbolic representation of our thought. So maybe now we’re in a position to actually get closer to the thinking behind it. And the idea is encapsulated because it doesn’t require to be physically manifested in a fixed medium. And unsurprisingly, at the moment, a lot of things we’re doing, despite our best intent attempts, are actually sort of re-manifesting elements of our print technology. And that doesn’t surprise me at all. And I don’t think it’s a bad thing for it. But I suppose my provocation is yes, well, we’re about future of text as much as we are VR. Well, <b>let’s let text move ahead from the print age into the VR age.<br></b><br>[<b>Fabien Benetou</b>]: Yeah. So just to reinforce this, if it’s indeed I think <b>if we love something and I know all of us love books, we have to be honest enough to admit the limitations</b>. We have to be honest enough about not just your but paper books, also the things that we cherish, let’s say computational notebooks, whatever those are, to be able to do better. So are, I think, not necessarily letting go of the book, but really being honest enough to criticise it and then not just have philosophical discussion, but once it’s been criticised, attempt to do something better.<br><br>[<b>Frode Hegland</b>]: Yeah, I just wanted to briefly say that the first ‘word’ was not flat. Let’s remember that because Fabien, you did the whole thing of saying we’re reclaiming space. Remember the very first notations humanity ever did in cave walls was not flat. It was drawing a buffalo on the shape of a buffalo. So when you have the torch go past, it would move. So, you know, we have a lot to go back to that kind of experience. <br><br>[<b>Brandel Zarchernuk</b>]: Very in line with where I’m going to go, which is as well as being an enthusiastic and hopefully reasonably competent practitioner in the VR space.<b> I’m also a firebrand, a zealot for the concept of extended mind and embodied cognition. </b><br>	Briefly, that is the view that we don’t simply think we exist in a world, we think basically through momentum, both figurative and literal meaning that<b> by doing things we focus our actions and our thoughts on what’s going on.</b> <br>	One of the most sort of damaging things that happened over the 20th century to add to my shopping list was the sort of the Taylorist view that because we we didn’t know anything, we couldn’t know anything about what was going on inside the mind that it didn’t matter and that we could also sort of abstract away a lot of the sort of particular sort of operating characteristics of what it was that a mind does. And at that same time as well, because I think in large part that because computing was at the outside of computing, we had ENIAC, UNIVAC, all of these enormous computers that you had to sort of set running and they were exercises in absolute and total abstraction. You had numbers representing things-as we do today–but we have enough cycles to burn as big to be able to kind of represent things as colours, represent things as motions. And in the future–at some point–hopefully being able to represent them as other sensations as well and. <br>	We are coming to the opportunities that are afforded to computers and to people using computers from a particularly bad piece of recent history in terms of our understanding of what it is that the human mind, the human body, the human sort of society needs out of computing in order to do information processing and if<b> I was to sort of reach in 54 years into the future, I would say, look back. Look back to now,</b> obviously if you’ve forgotten already, but try to look back further and much further into what information has been across the totality of human history when it has been met with and responded to very different sort of characteristics of cognitive modelling and the sort of the trends and tendencies of the way that information has been represented over the eras. Because like I said, the laws of physics don’t apply. <b>The the opportunities for representation of various things is wide open. </b>And it would be a tragedy for us to simply recapitulate all of the limitations that we currently have. As I’ve talked about in some of my videos, <b>word processing as it currently stands is is to do with recapitulation of the printed page. </b>Xerox PARC literally is the photocopier company. They they built some things to be able to represent things as though they were documents. It’s only just I think this year that Google Docs have said ‘we’re going to make it page list’ and it’s like this is a revolution. ‘Amazing’. ‘Congratulations’. <b>We have the opportunity to go so much further if we recognise the totality in the most general terms, what it is that we as human agents need and and really think about how we can make sure that we tailor computers and computing to those artefacts, to those characteristics, </b>rather than merely the ones that we understand or believe computers as they currently stand to be the best at. If we think about what humans are, as holistically as generously as possible, what it is that we need for computing, then hopefully we can make it better for all of us. <br><br>[<b>Matthias Müller-Prove</b>]: That’s hard. I totally agree. I can’t do better than you. And I don’t try. Anyway, that text is kind of magic time capsules. You can can talk to people who are no longer around or vice versa. They they talk to people that are not existing yet. But essentially, it’s the communication between people, asynchronously. And I would like to see a kind of well ‘<i>Sieb des Eratosthenes</i>’† in German so the seed of this is totally to find the prime numbers within the whole Corpus of texts so not everything at once. But some clever heuristics not saying Artificial Intelligence or not, but some clever collective heuristics really find the nuggets inside this corpus of clever ideas of humankind that would be cool to to interact with people that are not in this Zoom conference not now, not in the past, not in the future but get access to the the wisdom of the past and the future. <br><br>[<b>Fabien Benetou</b>]: So I’m listening to everyone, but I’m also coding and testing at the same time, we’re just what I showed before, now I know that I can put those pages of the future text, but I also can use my wiki, which is a graph, and I can open pages from the children of those wiki. So this is a practical illustration to basically say thank you Frode for organising this, for herding us and for everyone here and people watching because I don’t know if I’m thinking better than before, but I’m at least having a ton of fun. I do believe though that this is valuable, so I’m very happy to share. But yeah, to say thank you for for this community.<br><br>[<b>Frode Hegland</b>]: Thank you for saying that. I appreciate that. And I think also for our future descendants, that may be the key message, because<b> if we’re going to invent, we need to feel safe. First of all. And we need to be able to disagree.</b> You know, there are many ways to do that. So no matter what happens with technology, the human ways that humans are allowed to deal with each other will shape what human potential will be as much as any physical or technical attributes. So when I, very pretentiously in my presentation earlier today, talked about do we have the will to will to do this, I wasn’t just trying to be ridiculous and I wasn’t trying to be too high and mighty. <br>	The thing is, if we manage carefully to grow this community, not everybody being on every meeting, but by saying to discuss how to improve how we think and communicate through text and associated things, maybe somebody cleverer than us or just randomly will get that inspiration that will make something wonderful happen. <br>	Maybe it will be us. <br>	But, you know, as long as we keep plugging, in a real sense, who cares, right? All we care about is trying to do our best. And <b>I want to say to the far distant future, we really did try. </b>You know, we’re living in challenging times. But then, you know, if you look back at just 2019, we thought it was challenging then. And what’s happening to our planet since then is just insane. So in 54 years, I think our primary message to you is, ‘thank God you survived and you can see this or read this’. <br>	I look forward to seeing all of you in the future at various events. And thank you very much for today. Have a good weekend, everyone.<br><br><h1 id="A8D9172C-CB3B-4BBB-9C7B-93BFD52ABC94">Coda</h1><br><br><i>The following is a transcript of a presentation and conversation between Frode Hegland and Tim Brookes of the Endangered Alphabets project, conducted the Sunday after the book’s launch party and the public release the following Friday. </i><br><i>Edited for clarity and for brevity, some sections of non-pertinent discussion have been omitted.
